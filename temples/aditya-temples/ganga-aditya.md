## Story

Kashi Khand declares that Lord Surya chose a specific spot on the Varanasi riverfront to adore and praise Maa Ganga, and this radiant presence became known as Ganga Aditya. Even today, Surya is described as residing here reciting stotras to the Ganga, conferring blessings at the very edge of the sacred current where devotees gather at sunrise. The shrine‚Äôs location below the famous Nepali Mandir on Lalita Ghat roots it among Kashi‚Äôs most venerated river steps, where allied shrines such as Gangakeshav and Lalita Gauri also sanctify the precinct.

Within the Dwadash Aditya tradition of Kashi, Ganga Aditya holds a special grace: Kashi Khand promises that sincere worshippers are spared misfortune, deceit, and disease by Surya‚Äôs favor at this tirtha. The deity is enshrined in a modest room secured with an iron grill, facing the flowing Ganga, reminding pilgrims that Surya‚Äôs worship here is inseparable from the reverence to the river herself. Pilgrims approach from the lanes near Shri Kashi Vishwanath down to Lalita Ghat and identify the spot using Nepali (Pashupatinath) Mandir as the landmark, reinforcing the continuity of Himalayan Shaiva presence along Kashi‚Äôs banks.

Surya worship at the ghats is naturally aligned to daylight‚Äîthe first rays invite arghya, while river aarti glorifies the Goddess Ganga in the evenings‚Äîso the Ganga Aditya darshan blends seamlessly with Kashi‚Äôs daily rhythm of sunlight and sacred water. The scriptural assurance attached to this shrine makes it a favored stop in a Dwadash Aditya yatra, joining other Surya forms across Kashi that together illuminate a pilgrim‚Äôs path with vitality and protection.
