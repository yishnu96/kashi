### Story

A devotee named Vimal once lived in a hilly region and suffered from leprosy due to sins of a previous birth; hearing of Kashi‚Äôs supreme grace, he renounced home and wealth, came to Varanasi, and began intense worship of Lord Surya with full devotion and prescribed Surya rites. He performed daily arghya, pushpa-archana, and Surya stuti with steadfast mind; pleased by this sincere tapas, Suryadev manifested before Vimal and cured him completely of the dreaded disease by divine blessing.
Humbled and grateful, Vimal prayed that all devotees who worship at this place should be protected from such illness and not face hardships in life; Suryadev granted the boon and declared that he would reside here as Vimal Aditya to continually bless the faithful. Kashi Khand praises that even a mere darshan of Vimal Aditya cures diseases and cleanses sins, affirming this spot as a healing Surya kshetra within the sacred geography of Kashi.

In the living tradition, the small shrine stands in the gully behind Khari Kuan at Jangambari near Godowlia, where devotees offer arghya at sunrise and simple archana to Vimal Aditya, aligning their visit with other Aditya shrines in the old city lanes. The deity‚Äôs promise recorded in Kashi Khand‚Äîresiding in this murti to bless devotees‚Äîcontinues to define the temple‚Äôs reputation as a place of relief from disease and burden for pilgrims across generations.

By maintaining simple, earnest Surya upasana and seeking darshan here, pilgrims walk the same path of faith that Vimal established‚Äîreceiving the Sun God‚Äôs grace for health, purity, and removal of obstacles in the city of liberation.
