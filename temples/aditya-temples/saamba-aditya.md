### Story

In Dwaraka, Lord Krishna‚Äîthe abode of the universe‚Äîwas surrounded by many sons of radiant brilliance, and among them Saamba was renowned for beauty and valor, which set the stage for his great trial and redemption in Kashi. When Sage Narada visited and received reverent hospitality from the Yadavas, Saamba stood aloof, and Narada warned Krishna that such pride coupled with charm could bring danger in the royal household.

On a later visit, Narada found Krishna in private with his companions and called Saamba from outside to announce his arrival, placing the youth in a dilemma between disobeying a sage or intruding on his father‚Äôs privacy, and Saamba chose to enter with humility. Narada then misrepresented the moment to Krishna as if the women were enchanted by Saamba, provoking Krishna to utter a terrible curse of leprosy before realizing that a distortion had clouded the truth of the event.

Stricken yet repentant for the harshness of the curse, Krishna directed Saamba to Kashi, declaring that only there‚Äîby the compassion of Vishweshwara and the grace of Surya‚Äîcould such an affliction be removed and the sin dissolved in the sanctity of the world‚Äôs holiest city. Saamba came to Kashi, dug a sacred tank which came to be called Saamba Kund, and undertook rigorous penance and worship of the Sun, by which the power of Surya cured him of the dreadful disease.

Pleased with Saamba‚Äôs tapas, the Sun manifested here as the compassionate Saambaditya, the destroyer of ailments and bestower of wholesome prosperity, establishing this teerth as a living refuge for the sick and the sorrowing in Kashi. Kashi Khand proclaims that one who bathes at Saamba Kund at sunrise on Sunday and worships Saambaditya with devotion is never overcome by disease, for Surya‚Äôs rays here carry the scriptural assurance of healing and protection.

The Purana further blesses family life through this vow: a married woman who worships here remains a sumangali by divine grace, and a barren woman is granted a handsome son through Surya‚Äôs favor at this shrine of Saambaditya. The text also extols Magha Shukla Saptami (Rathasaptami) at Saamba Kund as equal in merit to an eclipse at Kurukshetra, and prescribes annual Sunday worship in the month of Chaitra with A≈õoka flowers after the sacred bath, removing grief and the sins of the year.

In the living cityscape, Saamba Kund is known today as Surya Kund or Suraj Kund, where a small shrine of Saambaditya stands; the broad plinth and two ancient Sun-discs nearby testify that an extensive temple once rose here in older times. Devotees come by rickshaw to the Surya Kund locality and perform the Sunday sunrise dip and Surya worship, walking in the footsteps of Saamba whose cure made this place a perennial hope for health and progeny in Kashi.

Within the Dwadash Aditya tradition that guards Kashi, Saambaditya shines as the healer among the twelve solar forms, anchoring the southern city‚Äôs faith in Surya‚Äôs compassion across generations of pilgrims. Thus, from Narada‚Äôs test and Krishna‚Äôs hard teaching to Saamba‚Äôs penance and Surya‚Äôs grace, this Kashi tale completes itself at Surya Kund where the Sun‚Äôs light becomes medicine for body and destiny alike.
