## Story

During the exile of the Pandavas, Draupadi came to Kashi and performed intense tapas to Lord Surya, distraught by the hardship of her husbands and seeking divine help in the city of light and liberation. Pleased by her devotion, Surya granted her the Akshaya Patra‚Äîan inexhaustible vessel to feed any number of guests, with the condition that Draupadi would partake last, establishing the ideal of feeding guests before oneself in sacred household conduct.

At this holy spot, Surya also conveyed the wish of Lord Shiva: in Kashi, the devotee who worships Surya first and then revered Vishweshwar would have sorrows removed by Surya‚Äôs rays, making Draupad Aditya a powerful tirtha for relief from grief, hunger, and misfortune according to Kashi Khand. The shrine is placed in the vicinity of Vishweshwar, traditionally noted to the west, and today lies within the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor precincts, integrating the Surya-first injunction into the living pilgrimage of the temple complex.

This sacred account firmly ties the blessings of Draupad Aditya with anna-k·π£ema and family welfare, as the boon of the Akshaya Patra symbolizes uninterrupted sustenance and compassionate sharing, a vow many devotees uphold here before proceeding to Sri Vishweshwar‚Äôs darshan. The site remains open for self-worship through the day, enabling pilgrims on the Dwadash Aditya Yatra to honor Surya‚Äôs grace in Kashi and align their journey with the scriptural sequence of worship.
