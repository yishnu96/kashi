## Story

Once Lord Surya, traversing the sky over Kashi, beheld Adi Keshav (Lord Vishnu) worshipping a sacred Shivling and respectfully asked why the Antaratma, revered as the indweller of all beings, was engaged in Shiva-puja in the holy city.

Lord Vishnu affirmed that within Kashi Kshetra, Lord Shiva is the supreme deity and must be worshipped by all, and then taught the greatness of Linga-puja in Kashi whereby abhishek of the Lingam and consuming the charanamrit grants the merit of bathing in all sacred teerths.

Accepting this instruction, Lord Surya took Adi Keshav as his Guru at that very spot and commenced worship of Lord Shiva in Kashi, and thus the Surya of this kshetra is venerated as Keshava Aditya.

This revelation is praised in Kashi Khand with the assurance that worship of Keshava Aditya bestows supreme knowledge culminating in Nirvana, making this Surya shrine a unique confluence of Vishnu-bhakti and Shiva-arpana.

The ground of this leela is the ancient Adi Keshav complex at Rajghat, standing where Lord Vishnu first entered Kashi and where the sacred Varuna meets the Ganga, a meeting celebrated in the scriptures as Padodaka Tirtha.

Here, Lord Vishnu bathed and sanctified the confluence, and the place became the gateway through which Vishnu‚Äôs compassion flowed to Kashi in fulfillment of the divine design narrated in the Kashi Khanda.

The Kashi Khanda recounts that before this episode, the saga of King Divodasa unfolded, wherein deities and yoginis failed to sway his flawless rule until Lord Vishnu entered Kashi to complete Shiva‚Äôs will.

After the holy bath and consecration, Adi Keshav established residence in Kashi and ordained the practices by which pilgrims would attain purification, protection, and ultimate knowledge through proper worship.

Within the Adi Keshav precinct is the revered Sangameshwar Linga, a distinctive four-faced swayam-pratishthita form revered as established by Adi Keshav, signifying the unity of the Lord at the confluence.

Darshan of Sangameshwar alongside Keshava Aditya forms the complete circuit of worship at this tirtha, binding Surya-puja, Vishnu‚Äôs grace, and Shiva‚Äôs supremacy in one sacred rhythm.

Kashi Khanda further prescribes Padodaka observances: bathing in Padodak Teerth, taking Padodak water as charanamrit, and performing abhishek grants remission of sins across seven births and wards off untimely death.

Shraddha and ancestral rites at Padodaka are held equal to Gaya in fruit, extending blessings across twenty-one generations, showing the extraordinary reach of merit anchored at this confluence.

For Keshava Aditya specifically, Kashi Khanda singles out the auspicious time of Magh month Saptami coinciding with a Sunday, directing devotees to take Padodak snan and then worship to obtain complete expiation.

Thus, the yearly turn of Magh Suryavarita Saptami becomes the crown of Surya worship in Kashi, carrying the stamp of Adi Keshav‚Äôs instruction and Surya‚Äôs humble obedience.

Through the centuries the temple witnessed trials and restorations; medieval destruction is recorded, followed by later patronage and repair under the Scindia lineage, which preserved the Adi Keshav sanctity for posterity.

Today the precinct retains an atmosphere of ancient serenity, bearing visible marks of history yet radiating the timeless assurance of Kashi Khand that knowledge and liberation abide at Keshava Aditya.

The narrative of Keshava Aditya, set upon the threshold of Padodaka, embodies the harmony of Vishnu and Shiva worship in Kashi and the scriptural promise that Surya-puja here becomes the light that leads from knowledge to Nirvana.

Pilgrims who follow the sequence of Padodak rites, Sangameshwar darshan, and Keshava Aditya worship step into this living current of grace ordained in the Skanda Purana‚Äôs Kashi Khanda.
