# Mayukh Aditya

Mayukh Aditya is a revered Surya shrine at Panchanada Teerth (Panchganga Ghat) where Kashi Khand says worship on Sunday removes disease and poverty, and where Surya‚Äôs intense tapas led Shiva to cool him and name him ‚ÄúMayukh,‚Äù meaning effulgence. Housed inside Mangala Gauri Temple with Gabhastheeshwar Mahadev, it is a key stop in the Aditya circuit and a powerful place for Surya upasana in Kashi.

### Story

At the sacred Panchanada Teerth, Lord Surya installed a Shiva Ling called Gabhastheeshwar and a Devi murti as Mangala Gauri, and began severe penance to please Lord Shiva for the welfare of beings and for divine grace in Kashi. The intensity of Surya‚Äôs tapas filled the world with unbearable heat; sunrays grew fiercer by the day and life came to a standstill, shaking Devas, sages, and common folk alike across the sacred city.

Moved by his steadfast devotion and the suffering of the world, Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati appeared before Surya at Panchganga, where Shiva gently touched Surya and calmed the blazing heat, restoring coolness and balance to creation in a single compassionate act. Opening his eyes, Surya sang praises of Shiva and Parvati; delighted, they granted boons, and Shiva declared that during Surya‚Äôs worship only rays were visible‚Äîthus this radiant form would be known as ‚ÄúMayukh Aditya,‚Äù the effulgent Sun of Kashi.

Kashi Khand further extols that devotees who worship Mayukh Aditya are freed from disease, and Sunday worship protects from poverty, affirming Surya‚Äôs grace for household prosperity and health in the city of liberation. The Gabhastheeshwar Lingam, established by Surya, is praised for absolution at Panchganga after a holy bath, tying Surya‚Äôs penance with Shiva‚Äôs anugraha in one sacred complex at the confluence of sanctity and light.

Local tradition keeps a living sign of Shiva‚Äôs touch: the Mayukh murti always remains moist and cool; even if wiped dry, moisture returns, which elders also connect to the hidden Dhootpapa river believed to flow beneath the shrine precincts at Panchganga. The broader lore of Panchganga recalls the meeting of holy streams, where Surya in the form of Mayukh Aditya performed tapas at the confluence, magnifying the teerth‚Äôs purificatory power and the glory of Surya worship in Kashi.

Within the Mangala Gauri Temple, devotees also worship Mangala Gauri, Gabhastheeshwar, and Mangal Vinayak, making a rounded darshan that combines Surya‚Äôs effulgence, Shiva‚Äôs liberation-bestowing presence, and Devi‚Äôs auspicious shakti for worldly and spiritual wellbeing. In practice, pilgrims bathe at Panchganga, offer arghya to the Sun, perform archana to Mayukh Aditya, and attend evening aarti, with many keeping Sunday vrata to receive the blessings promised in Kashi Khand 49.
