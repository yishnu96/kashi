# Uttarark Aditya

Uttarark Aditya is revered for the story of Sulakshana‚Äôs tapas and a goat‚Äôs steadfast devotion at Ark Kund, after which Maa Parvati blessed both and established Surya here for the welfare of devotees.

### Story

In Kashi, a Brahmin named Priyavrat and his dharmic wife Shubhavradha were blessed with a daughter, Sulakshana, whose birth in Moola star (first pada) with Guru in the fourth house caused concern in the family due to dosha considerations, and sorrow soon struck as both parents passed away.

After performing the last rites with full respect, Sulakshana chose tapas over despair and began intense penance to Lord Surya in his northern form as Uttarark Aditya at Ark Kund, seeking light and direction in the city of Shiva.
Every day at dawn a white goat came to the Kund, bathed in the cold waters, waited the entire day near the ascetic girl, and at dusk ate dry grass, drank Ark Kund water, and returned, repeating this for years and silently joining her vrata.

This quiet witness of devotion, through the girl‚Äôs steadfast tapas and the goat‚Äôs disciplined routine, made Ark Kund a living mandir of compassion where even a mute creature‚Äôs fidelity became part of Kashi‚Äôs sacred record.
One day Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati were travelling above Kashi and saw Sulakshana grown lean through tapasya, yet shining with inner strength, and they came down to grant a boon in recognition of her unwavering Surya-bhakti.

When asked to seek a boon, Sulakshana thought of the goat that stood beside her daily in sun, rain, and winter, and she asked that the boon be given to the goat instead of herself.
Maa Parvati, moved by such selfless love, declared that Sulakshana would be her eternal companion (Sakhi) and blessed the goat to be born as the daughter of the Kashi Raja in the next birth in reward for its devotion at Ark Kund.

She further ordained that the Kund would be remembered for the goat‚Äôs sincerity‚Äîespecially its winter snan‚Äîand that devotees should bathe here on Sundays of Paush month and worship Uttarark Aditya for divine blessings.
From that time, Surya is established here as Uttarark Aditya in the northern sector of Kashi at Ark Kund, which came to be known locally as Bakaria (Bakriya) Kund, preserving the memory of the goat‚Äôs tapas-sangat.

Traditional compilations record the name ‚ÄúBarkari/Bakaria Kund,‚Äù and local parlance today simply calls it Bakaria Kund, a living continuity from the Kashi Khand narrative.
Kashi Khand explains that Uttarark Aditya at Ark Kund grants joy, fearlessness, and equality to devotees, acting as a saviour of Kashi, with special fruit for those who combine Kund snan and Surya-puja in the Paush Sundays.

Pilgrims follow a simple sequence: early snan at the Kund, arghya to Surya, Aditya mantra-japa, darshan at the temple, and charity as per capacity, aligning their steps with the compassionate decree of Shiva and Parvati.
Over the years, the sacred geography remained constant: Alaipur side near Kashi City Station, lanes leading to Bakaria Kund, and the temple precinct where Surya‚Äôs northern grace flows to householders, travellers, and tapasvins alike.

Thus, the Uttarark Aditya kshetra stands as a testament that in Kashi even a goat‚Äôs steady faith becomes a bridge to boons, and a daughter‚Äôs sacrifice becomes Sakhi-hood with the Mother, blessing all who remember and worship.
