## Story

The Mahabharata narrates that Prajapati Kashyapa had thirteen wives, among whom Kadru and Vinata were daughters of Daksha. When Kashyapa blessed them with boons, Kadru asked for one thousand long-bodied serpent sons with great valor, while Vinata, prompted by her sister's wish, requested only two sons who would be more powerful and radiant than all of Kadru's children. Kashyapa granted their wishes and departed for forest penance, advising them to carefully nurture their forthcoming children.

Kadru laid one thousand eggs while Vinata laid two, and both placed them in warm pots for incubation. After five hundred years, Kadru's eggs hatched, releasing thousands of magnificent nagas of various forms who played joyfully with their mother. Vinata, watching Kadru's happiness with growing frustration, could not bear that her eggs remained unhatched. In her impatience and desperate desire to see her children, she secretly broke open one egg, revealing a child fully formed from the thighs upward but with incomplete lower limbs still developing.

This prematurely born child was Aruna, meaning dawn, whose radiant form would later color the morning sky. Aruna was filled with rage at his mother's hasty action that caused his deformity and pronounced a terrible curse: Vinata would become a slave to Kadru's serpent sons for five hundred years. However, softening slightly at his mother's tears, Aruna prophesied that the remaining egg would produce a son of extraordinary power who would eventually liberate her from bondage. Having declared this, Aruna rose majestically to the heavens where Prajapati Kashyapa appointed him as the eternal charioteer of Surya.

The curse manifested when Kadru and Vinata witnessed Uchchaihsravas, the divine white horse born from the ocean churning. Kadru claimed the celestial horse had a black tail while Vinata insisted it was pure white, and they wagered with the loser becoming the winner's slave. Confident in her observation, Vinata agreed, but the cunning Kadru secretly ordered her serpent sons to attach themselves to the horse's tail as black hairs. When they viewed Uchchaihsravas the next day, Vinata was horrified to see its tail appearing black and accepted her defeat, thus fulfilling Aruna's curse.

After another five hundred years, the second egg cracked open, revealing the mighty Garuda, the golden eagle who would become Vishnu's mount. Garuda, learning of the deception that enslaved his mother, embarked on the legendary quest to steal amrita from Indra's heavens to purchase their freedom. His successful mission freed Vinata from her bondage, completing Aruna's prophecy.

Meanwhile, the cosmic drama involving Surya and Rahu created another crisis. During the churning of the ocean, when gods and demons shared amrita, Surya and Chandra had pointed out Rahu disguised among the gods, causing Vishnu to behead him. The vengeful Rahu now periodically swallowed Surya, creating solar eclipses and filling the sun god with such fury that his intensified rays threatened to burn all creation. The terrified gods approached Brahma, who appointed Aruna to serve as Surya's charioteer and shield, positioning himself between Surya and the world.

Aruna accepted this cosmic responsibility, and his radiant form filters Surya's deadly heat while his presence as the dawn herald announces the sun's daily journey across the sky. In recognition of his sacrifice and service, Surya blessed Aruna, declaring that those who worship him as Arun Aditya would never know disease, obstacles, or the burning pain of sorrow. Thus Aruna, born from premature breaking yet transformed into the cosmic protector, established himself in Kashi where devotees seek his grace for health, prosperity, and liberation from all forms of suffering.
