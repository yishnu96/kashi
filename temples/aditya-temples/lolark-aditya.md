# Lolark Aditya

Lolark Aditya stands at the sacred Assi–Ganga confluence near Tulsi Ghat, where Kashi Khand praises bathing and darshan as supremely meritorious among Aditya shrines of Kashi. Chapter 46 of Kashi Khanda extols this teerth for cleansing sins, granting wishes, healing skin ailments, and freeing devotees from Pitru-rin through rites at the confluence called Lolark-Sangam.

## Story

When King Divodasa ruled as dharma incarnate, Mahadeva sent Suryadev to test him and to find a flaw that could diminish the king’s merit, but the Sun found no deviation from righteousness despite searching within and without the city for an entire year in many guises. Fearing to return without completing the task yet unable to fault Divodasa, the Sun chose to remain forever, dividing himself into twelve forms to guard the holy city; among these, Lolarka—“the eager Sun”—shines in the south at the meeting of Assi and Ganga.

Kashi Khanda declares that annual pilgrimage on the sixth tithi falling on a Sunday or on the seventh in Margashirsha frees a person from all sins, and the very sight of Lolark on such a Sunday destroys sins committed in the year; bathing at the Assi–Ganga confluence, offering to Pitrs and Devas, and performing shraddha release one from ancestral debt. Rites of bathing, dāna, homa, and arcana at the Lolark-Sangam yield never-ending merit and, during a solar eclipse, are proclaimed ten times more efficacious than those at Kurukshetra according to the Purana.

The scripture also assures that one who visits Lolark on Sundays observing purity will not face misery in this world, and he who drinks the charanamrita will be free from afflictions including itches, scabs, and other skin diseases; neglecting Lolark while living in Kashi invites suffering from hunger and sickness, emphasizing the gravity of this teerth in city life. The text further exalts Lolark as the foremost of Kashi’s teerths, stating that other teerths are but subsidiaries washed by its waters and that the benefit of bathing at the Assi–Ganga confluence equals the combined merit of ablutions at all teerths on earth.

In living tradition this manifests as the great festival of Lolark Shashti, held in Bhadrapada Shukla Shashti, when thousands take the sunrise dip in Lolark Kund near Tulsi Ghat seeking progeny and wellbeing; couples leave their wet clothes and a vowed fruit or vegetable in the kund, promising lifelong abstinence from that item. The kund itself is an ancient 15 m deep rectangular stepwell, with three sides stepped and the fourth like an arched well facing east; during rains, Ganga’s water enters the kund through subterranean channels, preserving the sense of the Assi–Ganga confluence celebrated in the Purana.

Kashi’s record and local memory reinforce this sanctity: copper-plate grants of Gahadavala kings attest to royal baths here, and the chapter situates Lolark among the twelve Adityas who continually protect Kashi from Tamasika forces; being scorched by Lolark’s rays and cut by the Assi’s current, great sinners cannot enter Kashi from the south. Thus, from the Purana’s account to present-day crowds, the radiance of Lolark Aditya remains a living vow of Surya’s grace at the city’s southern gateway of light.
