Adityas are the twelve radiant forms of Surya described in Kashi Khand and worshipped across Varanasi as a sacred circuit called the Dwadash Aditya Yatra, traditionally regarded as sons of Aditi and Sage Kashyapa in the solar lineage of Hindu tradition. In practice, Kashi uniquely preserves all twelve Aditya shrines, and many devotees undertake a full pradakshina of these temples for health, protection, and spiritual merit.

## Who are Adityas

- In Puranic tradition, the Adityas are solar deities, classically identified as sons of Aditi and Sage Kashyapa, with Surya manifesting in twelve distinct aspects across the yearly cycle.
- In Varanasi, these twelve aspects are enshrined as specific temples popularly known as the Dwadash Aditya, a configuration explicitly noted in guides and lists of Kashi’s temples.

## Significance

- Kashi Khand assigns distinct blessings to each Aditya, such as protection from misfortune and disease at Ganga Aditya, and health and prosperity benefits through Sunday worship and sacred-kund snan at several sites.
- Examples include Keshava Aditya granting supreme knowledge leading toward nirvana, Samba Aditya associated with cure from diseases through Sunday sunrise worship at Surya Kund, and Lolark Aditya whose festival bath is believed to cleanse sins of seven births.

## Why and how they came to Kashi

- During King Divodasa’s flawless rule (under Brahma’s condition that no gods should reside in Kashi), Shiva sent Yoginis to find faults; when they stayed on awed by the city, Shiva deputed Surya to test the kingdom.
- Surya, captivated by Kashi, established himself in twelve forms across the city rather than return, which Kashi Khand remembers as the origin of the Dwadash Aditya in Varanasi.

## Suggested route (clustered)

- Assi–Tulsi Ghat cluster: Lolark Aditya at Lolark Kund near Tulsi/Assi area; Samba Aditya at Surya Kund (Suraj Kund) nearby.
- Central ghats: Ganga Aditya below Nepali Mandir at Lalita Ghat; Vriddh Aditya near Mir Ghat off the lanes.
- Vishwanath corridor: Draupad Aditya is referenced near Akshay Vat within/adjacent to the Kashi Vishwanath complex in local coverage, so visit while in the temple area.
- Trilochan/Machchodari side: Khakholkh Aditya at Kameshwar Temple north of Trilochan, with Arun Aditya included in the twelve—use local signage or the official yatra list to pinpoint Arun Aditya while in this pocket.
- Panchganga Ghat: Mayukh Aditya at Mangala Gauri Temple on Panchganga Ghat.
- Rajghat: Keshava Aditya inside Adi Keshav Temple at Rajghat/Adi Keshav Ghat.
- Alaipur: Uttarark Aditya at Bakaria (Bakria) Kund near Varanasi City station side.
- Sankata–Chowk belt: Yama Aditya on the steps of Sankata Ghat; Vimal Aditya at Jangambari near Godowlia.

If a full-day circuit is preferred, start at Assi/Tulsi (Lolark, Samba), move north along ghats (Ganga, Vriddh, Mayukh), cover Vishwanath/Trilochan pocket (Draupad, Khakholkh, Arun), then Rajghat (Keshava), Alaipur (Uttarark), and finish at Sankata/Jangambari (Yama, Vimal), adjusting by temple timings and aarti slots shown on local boards and priest guidance
