### Story

Once in Kashi, an elderly devotee named Harit stood near the southern side of Vishalakshi Devi and began deep penance to Lord Surya, seeking strength to perform lifelong tapas in the city of liberation.

After long austerity, Lord Surya appeared and asked Harit to request a boon, and the old devotee humbly prayed for youth and vigor because true tapas needs a strong body and steady mind.
Pleased by his sincerity, Lord Surya granted the boon, and the frail elder became youthful and radiant at once, his limbs filled with energy fit for austerity and service.

Because Lord Surya was praised by an old man at this very spot, the Sun here came to be known as Vriddh Aditya, the Aditya who restores strength and removes the helplessness of age.
Kashi Khand declares the fruit of worship: one who bows to Vriddh Aditya on Sundays gains desired siddhi and is protected from misery, a promise that draws pilgrims to this small but powerful shrine in the heart of Lahori Tola.

Local tradition further repeats the assurance that those who regularly pray here remain ever-energetic, reflecting Surya‚Äôs grace that revived Harit for a life of tapas.
Set close to the Ganga at Mir Ghat and south of the popular Bade Hanumanji, the vriddha-kripa of Surya is remembered in the lanes where pilgrims pass to and from Dashashwamedh and Vishwanath.

Devotees often bathe at the ghats at sunrise, offer arghya to the Sun, visit Vishalakshi Devi, and then take darshan of Vriddh Aditya, completing a simple Surya‚ÄìShakti circuit cherished by Kashi‚Äôs elders and youth alike.
The temple remains open through the day, with a Surya chakra on the outer wall noted by visitors, and worship is simple and heartfelt, with mantra-japa, archana, and quiet prayer.

Thus the story of Harit stands in Kashi as living guidance: Surya‚Äôs light restores strength to the deserving, and Sundays at Vriddh Aditya become a weekly vrata for courage, health, and purposeful life.
