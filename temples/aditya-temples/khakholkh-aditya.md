## Story

Kashyapa Prajapati had two wives, Kadru and Vinata; Kadru bore the serpent race while Vinata gave birth to mighty Garuda, and between the sisters a wager arose about the color of Uchchaisrava, the celestial horse yoked to Surya‚Äôs chariot, with the loser to become the slave of the winner. Though Uchchaisrava was white, Kadru deceitfully ordered her serpent sons to coil upon its tail and spit venom to darken its hue, and Vinata‚Äîanswering truthfully‚Äîlost the wager and fell into slavery under Kadru and her sons. Garuda, pained by his mother‚Äôs suffering, begged the serpents for her release, and they set a harsh condition: bring the guarded pot of amrita from the devas in Svarga to win Vinata‚Äôs freedom.

As a dutiful son, Garuda soared to the celestial realm, facing fierce defenses placed around the nectar: a wall of fire, a whirling wheel with razor-sharp edges, and venomous serpents beneath, all guarding the amrita by Indra‚Äôs command and the devas‚Äô fear of losing sovereignty. With immense tapas-shakti and divine aid, Garuda overcame the fire and the spinning wheel, subdued the serpents, and seized the pot, and Lord Vishnu, moved by his devotion to his mother, blessed him to become the eternal vahana and emblem-bearer on his banner. On the way back, Indra pleaded that the amrita should not be consumed by the serpents, and Garuda promised to place it without allowing them to drink, securing both his mother‚Äôs freedom and the cosmic order upheld by the devas.

Garuda presented the amrita before the serpents to fulfill the condition, and as they went to bathe before partaking, Indra reclaimed the nectar, leaving only the kusa grass on which the pot had rested, which the serpents licked hoping for a drop and thereby split their tongues upon its sharp blades, a mark they bear from that day. With the condition met and the nectar removed by divine will, Vinata obtained her freedom, and mother and son turned to Kashi for atonement and thanksgiving at the supreme pilgrimage city praised by the scriptures. In Kashi, Garuda installed a Shiva Lingam and worshipped steadfastly at the feet of Mahadev, and nearby Vinata fashioned the image of Surya and performed rigorous penance to the Sun God for grace and absolution.

Pleased with Vinata‚Äôs devotion and the dharmic outcome of Garuda‚Äôs trials, Suryadev manifested at this sacred spot as Khakholkh Aditya, bestowing blessings upon devotees who come here in faith, especially for removal of sins, fulfillment of heartfelt wishes, and freedom from disease. Kashi Khand locates Khakholkh Aditya near the holy Pilpila Teerth in the Trilochan area, a site remembered today as a venerable well close to Trilochaneshwar, binding the Puranic account with the living cityscape of Kashi. In the wider Kashi narrative, Surya‚Äîsent once by Shiva to test King Divodas‚Äîchose to remain in Varanasi, and the Dwadash Aditya tradition flourished here, making Khakholkh Aditya a radiant link in the twelvefold worship of the Sun in the city of light.
