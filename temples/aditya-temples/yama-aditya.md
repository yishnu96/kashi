# Yama Aditya

Yama Aditya in Kashi is the Surya form consecrated by Yamraj at Yam Teerth, where Kashi Khanda assures freedom from the torments of Yamaloka for those who bathe at Sankata Ghat and worship Yameshwar and Yama Aditya with faith. It is one of the Dwadasha Aditya shrines, set between Yameshwar and Atma Veereshwar, and is revered for Pitru-karya, happiness, and safe passage after death as described in Kashi Khanda’s Aditya section.

### Story

Once, Dharmaraja Yamraj performed rigorous tapas on the sacred bank known as Yam Teerth in Kashi, establishing a Shiv Ling that became Yameshwar and an image of Lord Surya that became Yama Aditya, thus sanctifying this confluence of Shiva and Surya worship for the welfare of souls after death as recorded in Kashi Khanda. Kashi Khanda declares that a devotee who takes holy bath at Yam Teerth (today identified with the Ganga at Sankata Ghat), and then worships Yameshwar along with Yama Aditya, is spared the tortures of hell and attains an auspicious heavenly path, highlighting the unique grace of this teerth among Kashi’s sacred ghats. The text adds that forefathers eagerly await their descendants’ rites here, and it singles out a rare and powerful conjunction—when Tuesday, Bharani Nakshatra, and Chaturdashi coincide—as the prime time for Pitru-karya such as shraddha and pind daan, promising all-round happiness and relief from ancestral obligations (pind rin) to the faithful performer.

This Aditya sits on the steps to Sankata Ghat, with Sankata Devi Temple as a guiding landmark, creating a sacred cluster where Shakti, Shiva, and Surya are worshipped in one compact kshetra and the devotee can complete snan, Surya-puja, and Shiva-archana in one continuous vow as outlined by local tradition and Kashi Khanda references. Kashi’s Aditya tradition further positions Yama Aditya between Yameshwar and Atma Veereshwar, making the darshan-krama intuitive—bathe at the ghat, offer arghya to Surya as Yama Aditya, and bow to Shiva as Yameshwar, gaining happiness in life and safe passage after death as stated by the Purana compilers. Because Surya is propitiated especially on Sundays across Hindu practice, and because Yama Aditya is tied to Pitru rites by Kashi Khanda, pilgrims often choose a Sunday morning snan and surya-arpan for general prosperity, or wait for the rare Tuesday–Bharani–Chaturdashi alignment to perform comprehensive Pitru-karya, following the injunctions preserved by Kashi’s temple custodians and texts.
