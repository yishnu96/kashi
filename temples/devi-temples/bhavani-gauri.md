## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

The origins and glory of Bhavani Gauri Temple in Kashi are woven deeply into the very foundation of Varanasi‚Äôs spiritual legends. In ancient times, King Divodasa ruled Kashi, ensuring peace and prosperity. His lineage continued with the celebrated Kashi Naresh, who had a daughter named Sashikala, of unmatched beauty and virtue. Seeking an ideal groom, the king organized a grand Swayamvar, inviting princes from across Aryavarta.

Sashikala‚Äôs heart had already united with Sudarshan, a vanvasi prince blessed with deep devotion and immense valor. Through clandestine means and guided by fate, the king arranged their secret marriage, honoring Sashikala's love and Sudarshan's spiritual strength. When the other princes discovered the secret union, egos were wounded. Multiple kingdoms allied and declared war on Kashi, threatening its peace and sanctity.

In this moment of grave danger, Sudarshan retreated to the forests, filled with doubt but unwavering in faith. He meditated with profound intensity, seeking the protection of the ultimate Mother, Durga. As described in Devi Bhagavata Purana, Durga manifested suddenly, mounted upon her lion, radiant and fierce as thousands of suns. Her form as Bhavani Gauri shined in all directions.

With supreme grace, Bhavani Gauri unleashed her powers, defending Kashi with unmatched might. The opposing kings fell in awe; the battlefield became a stage for divine intervention as celestial weapons danced and the lion‚Äôs roar echoed through the heavens. Sudarshan, filled with gratitude, performed a yajna and sang praises of Bhavani Gauri, appealing for Varanasi‚Äôs perpetual safety. At his request, the king and Sudarshan built the first Bhavani Gauri shrine on Kashi‚Äôs sacred soil, inviting all householders, ascetics, and pilgrims to seek her blessings for overcoming obstacles, gaining prosperity, and attaining ashta siddhis.

The Kashi Khanda further details Bhavani Gauri‚Äôs unique place in the circuit of nine Nav Gauri temples. Each is a distinct manifestation of Shakti; Bhavani Gauri is worshipped specifically on the seventh day of Navratri during Chaitra and Vasanta (spring) Navratri for fulfillment of wishes and removal of sorrows. She bestows the power to create new worlds, both physical and spiritual, and equips all her true devotees with the ability to transcend difficulties and experience divine bliss. Her image in the Ram Mandir, flanked by Kali Devi and Jagannath, displays weapons and symbols of abundance: the bow, arrow, lotus, nectar-pot, rosary, mace, and spinning wheel. Her lion mount signifies her mastery over ego and adversity.

Pilgrims must first bathe in the Bhavani Teerth ‚Äì the sacred water point whose legends hold that a drop of Mother‚Äôs grace here dissolves sin and renews energy for sadhana. Devotees circumambulate the shrine eight times daily, and 108 times on auspicious Ashtami, as instructed by Kashi Khanda. Those who approach with pure heart, faith, and follow the ritual sequence ‚Äì Annapurna Devi darshan first, Bhavani Gauri next ‚Äì are gifted prosperity, happiness, and liberation (moksha). Throughout the annual festivals, especially on Saptami of Navratri, the temple fills with chants, flowers, and lamp-light; the ancient promise etched in the scriptures is repeatedly fulfilled: ‚ÄòBhavani Gauri will forever shield those who honor her in Kashi.‚Äô
