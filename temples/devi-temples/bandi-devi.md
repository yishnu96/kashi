## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

In the divine epochs when righteousness and evil battled across the three worlds, there lived a powerful demon king named Ahiravan in the depths of Patal Lok. This mighty Asura was the brother of the great Ravana and possessed extraordinary magical powers that made him nearly invincible. His fortress in the underworld was protected by countless barriers and enchantments that no ordinary being could penetrate.

During the great war of Lanka, when Lord Rama and his devoted brother Lakshmana were fighting valiantly against the forces of darkness, Ahiravan devised a treacherous plan. Using his mastery over dark magic and deception, he assumed the form of Vibhishana, Rama's trusted ally, and approached the brothers during the quiet hours of night when they rested after battle.

The demon's disguise was so perfect that even the vigilant Lakshmana could not detect the deception. Speaking in Vibhishana's gentle voice, Ahiravan requested the brothers to accompany him to a sacred place for an important ritual that would ensure their victory in the war. Trusting completely, both Rama and Lakshmana followed what they believed to be their ally.

But as soon as they stepped into Ahiravan's magical circle, the earth beneath their feet opened like a great mouth, and they found themselves transported to the dark realm of Patal Lok. The demon's true form was revealed as he laughed triumphantly, having successfully captured the two greatest warriors of dharma. His plan was to sacrifice them to the dark goddess Kali in a terrible ritual that would grant him supreme power over all the worlds.

In Patal Lok, Ahiravan's palace was a marvel of dark architecture, with chambers that shifted and changed according to his will. He placed Rama and Lakshmana in a prison that was sealed with locks forged from the essence of darkness itself. These locks could not be broken by any weapon or power known to the celestial or mortal realms. The demon was confident that his captives would never escape.

However, what Ahiravan did not know was that Patal Lok was also the sacred dwelling of Bandi Devi, a magnificent manifestation of the Divine Mother Shakti. She had been residing in these depths since the Treta Yuga, not as an exile, but as the guardian deity who watched over those unjustly imprisoned and bound. Her presence in Patal was by the divine command of Lord Vishnu himself, who had foreseen that someday the forces of dharma would need her protection in this realm of darkness.

Bandi Devi appeared before the imprisoned princes in her four-armed divine form, radiating a light so brilliant that it illuminated every corner of the dark prison. Her eyes sparkled with compassion and divine power, and her voice carried the authority of the cosmos itself. She spoke to Rama and Lakshmana, revealing her identity as the Divine Mother who liberates all beings from unjust bondage and imprisonment.

"O princes of Ayodhya," she said, "your devotion to dharma has reached my ears even in these depths. I am Bandi Devi, the liberator of the bound, the opener of all locks that bind the innocent. Ahiravan's magic may be powerful, but no force in creation can stand against the will of the Divine Mother when she chooses to protect her devotees."

The goddess then performed a divine miracle that would become the foundation of her worship for all time. She manifested thousands of keys that gleamed like stars in the darkness, each one capable of opening any lock in existence. With a gentle gesture, she used these celestial keys to unlock every chain, every barrier, and every magical binding that held the brothers captive.

But Bandi Devi's assistance did not end with their liberation. She guided Rama and Lakshmana through the maze-like passages of Ahiravan's palace, showing them the secret chamber where the demon kept his life force hidden in five lamps burning in different directions. She revealed the strategy needed to extinguish all five lamps simultaneously, which was the only way to defeat the seemingly invincible Ahiravan.

Following her divine guidance, Hanuman, who had also descended to Patal Lok in search of the princes, was able to assume a massive form and blow out all five lamps at once, thus ending Ahiravan's reign of terror forever. The demon's death liberated countless innocent souls who had been imprisoned in his dark realm.

Before the brothers departed from Patal Lok, Bandi Devi made a sacred promise that would echo through the ages. She declared that she would establish her divine presence in the holy city of Kashi, where she would be accessible to all devotees facing imprisonment, legal troubles, or any form of unjust bondage. She promised that anyone who worshipped her with sincere devotion would find their chains broken and their freedom restored.

True to her word, Bandi Devi manifested her divine presence near the sacred Dashashwamedh Ghat in Kashi, where the cosmic energies are most powerful. She chose this location because the ghat represents the meeting point between the earthly and divine realms, making it the perfect place for her to respond to the prayers of those seeking liberation.

From that divine moment onward, Bandi Devi became known as the goddess who breaks all bonds and frees all captives. Her worship spread throughout Kashi and beyond, as people discovered the miraculous power of her intervention in their lives. Those facing legal troubles, family disputes, supernatural afflictions, or any form of imprisonment found their liberation through her grace.

The tradition of offering locks and keys to Bandi Devi originated from this sacred story. Devotees bring locks to symbolize their problems and bondages, placing them before the goddess with complete faith. When their troubles are resolved and their freedom is restored, they return with keys to unlock these same locks, then immerse both lock and key in the holy Ganga as a gesture of gratitude and completion.

This sacred practice represents the eternal cycle of bondage and liberation that governs all existence, with Bandi Devi serving as the divine force that breaks through all limitations and grants freedom to her devoted children.
