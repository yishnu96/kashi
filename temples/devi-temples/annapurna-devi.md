## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

Thousands of years ago, Kashi shone as the eternal city favored by the gods and rishis. The supreme Lord Shiva, Mahadeva, made Kashi his home, guiding humanity from the banks of the sacred Ganga. But an unimaginable crisis struck the city‚Äîa devastating epidemic swept across Kashi, snatching away food and joy, leaving its people hungry, weak, and hopeless. Every household in Varanasi was touched by famine, and the whispers of suffering grew louder with every passing day.

From his sanctum beside the river, Lord Shiva beheld the agony of his beloved city. His heart moved by compassion, he pondered: how to restore not only food but faith to Kashi? Shiva, the cosmic sannyasi, did not possess worldly riches or stores of grain. Instead, he knew the source of true abundance‚Äîthe divine power of Shakti embodied as Maa Annapurna, the goddess who sustains all with her eternal nourishment.

Resolute, Shiva himself approached Maa Annapurna. Bowing before her, he humbly requested alms, not for himself alone, but as the guardian of Kashi, for all the city's starving souls. The sight of mighty Mahadeva seeking food for his devotees moved Annapurna deeply. She gazed upon Kashi, her compassion blooming like the thousand-petaled lotus, and decreed a divine boon: "From today onward, none who seek my blessings in Kashi shall ever suffer hunger. The city shall be a place of abundance, and I will fill every empty bowl with nourishment." Thus, through her grace and Lord Shiva‚Äôs mediation, Kashi became the most blessed city, forever shielded from hunger and famine.

Maa Annapurna‚Äôs generosity did not end here. Each year, on the auspicious day after Diwali‚Äîthe Annakoot festival‚Äîthe boon is renewed in grand public celebration. Devotees assemble in her temple, which stands adjacent to Kashi Vishwanath. They receive from the hands of the priests coins, bundles of grain, and rice known as treasures (Nidhi) and Prasad. Scriptures affirm: those who keep these treasures safely in their homes enjoy prosperity and abundance all year, as the goddess‚Äôs blessings extend protection against all forms of scarcity.

Over centuries, kings and pilgrims have thronged to her sanctum. Peshwa Baji Rao, a legendary Maratha ruler, erected her temple in 1729, ensuring her worship flourished and no person in Kashi ever faces starvation. Adi Shankaracharya, the master philosopher, composed the Annapurna Stotram right here, praising her power over all three worlds.

In the temple, her idol sits golden and radiant upon the lotus, bestowing daily Annadanam‚Äîmass feeding‚Äîupon every seeker, regardless of caste, faith, or fortune. The Annakshetra in the temple premise serves free meals as an unbroken tradition, exemplifying the goddess‚Äôs eternal promise. Even today, amidst changing seasons and turbulent times, the city‚Äôs poor and pilgrims find shelter and food at her feet, confirming the glory and living presence of Maa Annapurna in eternal Kashi.

Thus, the temple is not only a shrine but the beating heart of Varanasi‚Äôs tradition of compassion and universal nourishment. It stands as the foundation stone of hope for every guest and citizen‚Äîwhere food, blessings, and spiritual fulfillment flow ceaselessly, guided by the divine hand of Annapurna Mata.
