## The Sacred Story

*── From Sthala Purana*

In the Kashi Khanda narrative, Lord Shiva resided at Mandarachal while King Divodasa, a dharmic ruler, governed Kashi with such excellence that an agreement with Lord Brahma kept devas and celestial beings away so that pilgrim worship remained undisturbed and the king’s rajadharma stayed spotless in Avimukta Kshetra. Bereft of Kashi’s presence, Shiva sought a way to return and dispatched the sixty‑four Yoginis to create a lapse that would break the pact, yet when these divine Shaktis beheld Kashi’s sanctity and beauty, they chose to settle across the kshetra, anchoring their powers at chosen spots that became Shakti Peethas in the city itself. Among these established seats, Kamakhya (Kamakshi) took her place in Kamachha, infusing the site with Devi’s irresistible kāma‑shakti that grants clarity of mind, victory in debates, and auspicious fruition of endeavors to steadfast devotees.

Kashi Khanda (Chapter 72) further illuminates Kamakhya as a “mahāśakti” formed by the Goddess during the war with the asura Durgasur, with the Yoginis manifesting at specific spots, each location becoming a radiating center of Shakti where upasana yields divine energy and siddhi for seekers aligned to the Devi’s will. This scriptural frame merges with Kamakhya’s pan‑Indic identity—celebrated in stotra as Kamarupa‑samudbhuta, Kamapitha‑avatamsaka, the Great Maya sustaining the worlds—enshrining the Kashi seat as an upa‑peeth where the same primordial power is worshipped in the yantra form. In this mandir, the sanctum’s heart is the Shri Mahamudra Yantra, affirming Kamakhya’s tantic essence and focusing worship on the inherent śakti present in the bindu and intersecting lines of the sacred diagram, as documented by priestly testimony.

The living tradition here celebrates Ambuvachi Yoga Parva in the month of June, when the garbhagriha remains closed for three days to honor the Devi’s generative mystery, after which devotees receive the prasad‑vastra once offered to the yantra, and the temple performs a solemn Maha‑abhishek followed by the special annual darshan of the Shri Mahamudra Yantra. This observance binds Kashi’s Kamachha to the cosmic rhythm of Kamakhya worship, ensuring that spiritual seekers experience the Devi’s compassion as both tapas and anugraha—ascetic pause and gracious outpouring—within the sanctified cadence of the festival.

The Kashi tradition recounts further that the Devi’s presence here stands in companionship with Kameshwar across the city’s sacred geography, echoing the Shiva‑Shakti unity that defines Kashi’s metaphysical spine and guiding pilgrims to pair their darshan of the Kamakhya Devi seat with Shiva’s Kameshwar murti in a complete yatra of desire’s sublimation into liberation. In practical grace, the Devi’s boon is immediate and worldly—mental calm, steadiness, and debated victory—yet its deeper fruit is the alignment of kama with dharma, as her yantra, unseen to the casual eye and carefully protected from photography, draws the mind from form to essence and from seeking to surrender. Thus, Kamachha’s yantra‑peeth remains a luminous node of Kashi’s Shakti circuit, where the 64 Yogini lore, the Durgasur victory, and the living Ambuvachi rites converge into a single continuous darshan of the Mother’s power.
