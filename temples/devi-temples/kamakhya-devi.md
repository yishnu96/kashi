## History of the Mandir

  * The shrine is recognized in Kashi‚Äôs sacred topography as the Kamakhya Devi (Kamakshi) seat associated with the 64 Yoginis of Kashi Khanda, Chapter 45 and 72 narratives.
  * The locality name ‚ÄúKamachha‚Äù derives from Kamakhya, underlining the temple‚Äôs long‚Äëstanding identity in the area.
  * Local tradition recorded in a news feature attributes establishment to Maharaj Dhananjay and presents the temple as a northern yantra‚Äëpeeth with a Shri Mahamudra Yantra in the sanctum.
  * The same feature states the temple is of very ancient origin and highlights its Ambuvachi Yoga Parva observance with a three‚Äëday closure and subsequent Maha‚Äëabhishek and annual yantra darshan.
  * The current puja is served by Shri Digambar Vireshwar Puri, preserving the site‚Äôs Shakti upasana and daily worship schedule.

## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

In the Kashi Khanda narrative, Lord Shiva resided at Mandarachal while King Divodasa, a dharmic ruler, governed Kashi with such excellence that an agreement with Lord Brahma kept devas and celestial beings away so that pilgrim worship remained undisturbed and the king‚Äôs rajadharma stayed spotless in Avimukta Kshetra. Bereft of Kashi‚Äôs presence, Shiva sought a way to return and dispatched the sixty‚Äëfour Yoginis to create a lapse that would break the pact, yet when these divine Shaktis beheld Kashi‚Äôs sanctity and beauty, they chose to settle across the kshetra, anchoring their powers at chosen spots that became Shakti Peethas in the city itself. Among these established seats, Kamakhya (Kamakshi) took her place in Kamachha, infusing the site with Devi‚Äôs irresistible kƒÅma‚Äëshakti that grants clarity of mind, victory in debates, and auspicious fruition of endeavors to steadfast devotees.

Kashi Khanda (Chapter 72) further illuminates Kamakhya as a ‚ÄúmahƒÅ≈õakti‚Äù formed by the Goddess during the war with the asura Durgasur, with the Yoginis manifesting at specific spots, each location becoming a radiating center of Shakti where upasana yields divine energy and siddhi for seekers aligned to the Devi‚Äôs will. This scriptural frame merges with Kamakhya‚Äôs pan‚ÄëIndic identity‚Äîcelebrated in stotra as Kamarupa‚Äësamudbhuta, Kamapitha‚Äëavatamsaka, the Great Maya sustaining the worlds‚Äîenshrining the Kashi seat as an upa‚Äëpeeth where the same primordial power is worshipped in the yantra form. In this mandir, the sanctum‚Äôs heart is the Shri Mahamudra Yantra, affirming Kamakhya‚Äôs tantic essence and focusing worship on the inherent ≈õakti present in the bindu and intersecting lines of the sacred diagram, as documented by priestly testimony.

The living tradition here celebrates Ambuvachi Yoga Parva in the month of June, when the garbhagriha remains closed for three days to honor the Devi‚Äôs generative mystery, after which devotees receive the prasad‚Äëvastra once offered to the yantra, and the temple performs a solemn Maha‚Äëabhishek followed by the special annual darshan of the Shri Mahamudra Yantra. This observance binds Kashi‚Äôs Kamachha to the cosmic rhythm of Kamakhya worship, ensuring that spiritual seekers experience the Devi‚Äôs compassion as both tapas and anugraha‚Äîascetic pause and gracious outpouring‚Äîwithin the sanctified cadence of the festival.

The Kashi tradition recounts further that the Devi‚Äôs presence here stands in companionship with Kameshwar across the city‚Äôs sacred geography, echoing the Shiva‚ÄëShakti unity that defines Kashi‚Äôs metaphysical spine and guiding pilgrims to pair their darshan of the Kamakhya Devi seat with Shiva‚Äôs Kameshwar murti in a complete yatra of desire‚Äôs sublimation into liberation. In practical grace, the Devi‚Äôs boon is immediate and worldly‚Äîmental calm, steadiness, and debated victory‚Äîyet its deeper fruit is the alignment of kama with dharma, as her yantra, unseen to the casual eye and carefully protected from photography, draws the mind from form to essence and from seeking to surrender. Thus, Kamachha‚Äôs yantra‚Äëpeeth remains a luminous node of Kashi‚Äôs Shakti circuit, where the 64 Yogini lore, the Durgasur victory, and the living Ambuvachi rites converge into a single continuous darshan of the Mother‚Äôs power.
