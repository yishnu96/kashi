## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

In the ancient times when darkness and evil threatened the cosmic order, a terrible demon named Durgasur emerged with unprecedented powers. This demon's reign of terror spread across the three worlds, causing immense suffering to gods, sages, and all living beings. The demon's army was vast and his strength seemed insurmountable, leaving the celestial beings in desperate need of divine intervention.

When the situation became unbearable, the gods approached Maa Durga, the supreme divine mother and protector of the universe. Understanding the gravity of the threat posed by Durgasur, the Goddess decided to send her most powerful and fierce manifestation to deal with this menace. From her divine energy emerged Kalratri, the seventh form of Durga, embodying the very essence of destruction and protection.

Kalratri's appearance was both terrifying and magnificent. Her body was as dark as the deepest night, representing the primordial darkness that existed before creation. Her wild, disheveled hair flowed in all directions like cosmic winds, symbolizing the untamed forces of nature. Around her neck gleamed a garland that sparkled like lightning, illuminating the darkness with divine energy. Her three eyes, round as the universe itself, continuously emitted rays of brilliant light that could pierce through any illusion or deception.

From her nostrils, Kalratri breathed forth continuous streams of fire, creating an atmosphere of divine wrath that could consume all evil. Her mount was a humble yet loyal donkey, representing her connection to the earth and her willingness to use any means necessary to protect dharma. Her four arms carried the instruments of both blessing and destruction - her upper right hand was raised in the mudra of blessing, while her lower right hand offered protection to devotees. In her left hands, she wielded an iron thorn and a deadly dagger, symbols of her power to destroy evil forces.

When Kalratri descended to confront Durgasur's army, the very earth trembled with her divine presence. The demon's warriors, confident in their strength and numbers, advanced toward her with weapons drawn. But as they approached, Kalratri opened her mouth and exhaled with a thunderous roar that shook the heavens. From her breath emerged countless fireballs that streaked across the sky like meteors, each one finding its target among the demon warriors.

Thousands upon thousands of Durgasur's soldiers were instantly incinerated by these divine flames. The battlefield became a scene of cosmic justice as evil was purged by the sacred fire of Kalratri's wrath. Those warriors who attempted to flee found themselves pursued by the relentless flames, for there is no escape from divine justice when it manifests in its full fury.

Witnessing the destruction of his army, Durgasur flew into an uncontrollable rage. He commanded his remaining forces to pursue and destroy this fierce goddess who had dared to challenge his supremacy. But Kalratri, having completed her initial mission, took flight through the celestial skies with the speed of divine wind, her dark form cutting through the cosmos like a bolt of supernatural lightning.

She soared directly to the sacred abode of Maa Durga near the Vindhyachal mountains, where the supreme goddess maintained her divine court. Bowing before the cosmic mother, Kalratri reported every detail of the battle, describing how Durgasur's army had been decimated and how the demon king himself was now filled with murderous rage, seeking direct confrontation with the divine forces.

Maa Durga, pleased with Kalratri's successful mission, prepared for the final confrontation with Durgasur. When the demon arrived at the sacred mountain, his eyes blazing with fury and his form radiating malevolent energy, the ultimate battle between good and evil commenced. The Goddess, in her infinite wisdom and power, released all her divine Shaktis, who manifested as powerful female warriors, each possessing extraordinary abilities and weapons forged in the fires of cosmic creation.

The battle that followed was of epic proportions, with the very elements of nature participating in the cosmic struggle. Mountains shook, rivers changed their course, and the sky itself seemed to split open with the force of divine weapons clashing against demonic power. The detailed description of this war, as recorded in the sacred Kashi Khand, speaks of supernatural feats, miraculous interventions, and the ultimate triumph of dharma over adharma.

Through her supreme divine power and the collective strength of all her manifestations, including the fierce Kalratri, Maa Durga finally defeated Durgasur and his remaining deputies. The demon's death marked the end of a dark era and the restoration of peace and righteousness throughout the cosmos. The gods and sages celebrated this victory by reciting the sacred Vajra Panchakam, hymns of praise that pleased the Goddess immensely.

In recognition of her victory over Durgasur, the supreme goddess assumed the eternal name of Durga Devi. She blessed all devotees, declaring that those who recite the Vajra Panchakam with devotion would overcome all obstacles in their spiritual and material lives. Most importantly for the sacred city of Kashi, Durga Devi announced that she would forever guard this holy place through her various divine manifestations stationed throughout the city.

Kalratri, having played such a crucial role in this cosmic victory, was given a permanent place of honor in Kashi. The Goddess declared that devotees who worship Kalratri in this sacred city would be blessed with absolute fearlessness. No fear of fire, water, wild animals, enemies, or the darkness of night would ever trouble them. Evil forces, demons, and negative energies would flee at the very thought of her name, for her power to destroy darkness and protect the innocent was now established for all eternity.

Thus, the temple of Kalratri in Kashi became not just a place of worship, but a fortress of divine protection where the fierce compassion of the cosmic mother continues to shield devotees from all forms of fear and evil, making it one of the most powerful and revered Shakti Peeths in the holy city.
