## The Sacred Story

In her previous incarnation, the Divine Mother was born as Sati, the beloved daughter of the powerful King Daksha Prajapati. Sati's heart was completely devoted to Lord Shiva, and despite her father's strong opposition, she married the ascetic god. Daksha, filled with pride and ego, harbored deep resentment towards Shiva and could never accept his unconventional son-in-law.

The crisis came when Daksha organized a grand Yagna, a magnificent sacrificial ritual to which he invited all the celestial beings, gods, and great sages. However, in his arrogance and spite, he deliberately excluded both Lord Shiva and Sati from the invitation list. When Sati learned of this great insult, her heart burned with pain and anger. Despite Lord Shiva's gentle advice to avoid the gathering, Sati's sense of duty towards her father compelled her to attend the Yagna uninvited.

Upon arriving at her father's palace, Sati witnessed the unthinkable. Not only had Daksha failed to reserve any seat for Lord Shiva, but he also began publicly insulting her beloved husband before all the assembled guests. He called Shiva names, mocked his appearance, and questioned his worthiness. The assembled crowd watched in uncomfortable silence as Daksha's harsh words echoed through the sacrificial hall.

Sati could not bear to hear such disrespect towards her husband. Her divine consciousness awakened with tremendous force. She stood up in the middle of the assembly and declared that she could not continue living in a body that was born from someone who showed such disrespect to Lord Shiva. With her yogic powers, she invoked the sacred fire within herself and gave up her life in the flames, right there in front of everyone.

When Lord Shiva learned of Sati's tragic end, his grief transformed into terrible wrath. His divine anger created Veerbhadra, a fierce manifestation who destroyed Daksha's Yagna completely. The entire sacrificial ground was devastated, and Daksha himself was beheaded. Though Shiva later restored Daksha to life with a goat's head, the cosmic order had been disturbed forever.

Sati's body was scattered across the earth, creating the sacred Shakti Peethas where devotees could worship the Divine Mother. However, the story did not end there. The Divine Mother, in her infinite compassion, chose to return to the world. She took birth as the daughter of Himavan, the king of the mighty Himalaya mountains, and his queen Menavati. As the daughter of the mountain king, she became known as Shailputri - the daughter of the mountain.

In this new life, Shailputri grew up as a beautiful and divine princess in the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas. But destiny had written that she would once again become the consort of Lord Shiva. Through her devotion and penance, she won Shiva's heart once more, and they were united in divine marriage.

The connection to Kashi comes from a beautiful episode when Maa Shailputri, after some disagreement with Lord Shiva, decided to travel and explore the world. During her wanderings, she arrived in the sacred city of Kashi. The moment she set foot in this holy city, she was overwhelmed by its spiritual energy and divine vibrations. Kashi's sacred atmosphere, blessed by Lord Vishwanath's eternal presence, captivated her heart completely.

When Lord Shiva realized that his beloved had left their mountain abode, he too came to Kashi to bring her back. But by then, Maa Shailputri had already fallen in love with the sacred city. She declared that Kashi would become her permanent residence, and she established herself at Marhia Ghat, making this temple her eternal dwelling place. From that day forward, she has remained in Kashi as the protective mother of all devotees who seek her blessings.

This is why the temple is considered so powerful - it houses the living presence of the Divine Mother who chose Kashi as her home, making every prayer offered here reach directly to her compassionate heart.
