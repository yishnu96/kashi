## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

Chamunda Devi Temple‚Äôs origins are described in the Devi Mahatmya and the Kashi Khanda. The events take place during the legendary battle between the gods and demons, when the world was threatened by the mighty generals Chanda and Munda, commanded by Shumbha and Nishumbha‚Äîenemies who could not be vanquished by any Deva or force of nature.

Mahasiddha Sukracharya, the powerful Guru of the Asuras, prepared Chanda and Munda to become undefeated beings. Their cruelty spread terror across all the worlds, defeating devas and sending fear into every living heart. The gods, unable to withstand their force, sought refuge in Goddess Parvati, manifest as Kaushiki Devi, who was radiant and divine.

At the climax of the cosmic battle, Kaushiki Devi frowned, her eyebrows contracting in righteous rage. From that frown emerged a radiant Shakti‚ÄîChamunda Devi, ferocious in appearance yet supremely compassionate toward the suffering of creation. Emaciated after severe austerities and divine hunger, she roared and leapt into battle.

Chamunda Devi rushed onto the battlefield, surrounded by her wild yogini companions, armed with deadly weapons and possessed of untamed power. The battle was fierce: the demon generals charged at Devi with immense force, wild storms of arrows and weapons clashing across the sky. In a display of ultimate courage, Chamunda Devi devoured the demon warriors, her hunger insatiable from ages of penance. Facing Chanda and Munda directly, she battled with unearthly strength‚Äîher laughter echoing as she tore through their magical defenses.

In the decisive moment, Chamunda Devi slew Chanda and Munda, thus liberating the earth and the heavens from their evil. She took their severed heads to Kaushiki Devi. Pleased, Kaushiki blessed this manifestation, declaring her "Chamunda," named after her triumph over Chanda and Munda. The energy of Chamunda resided in the sacred spot where the current temple stands, and thus the place became a Siddha Peetha for devotees.

Another ancient tale says that in a battle between Lord Shiva and the demon Jalandhara, Chamunda Devi was enshrined as chief Goddess with the title of Rudra, marking this land as potent for both Shiva and Shakti.

The temple, once located deep in a remote Himalayan forest, was moved during the 16th-17th century following divine instructions received in the dreams of a Brahmin priest and the regional king. As guided, the priest prepared himself with ritual purity, bathed before sunrise, and approached the holy spot. Alone, he was able to lift the heavy idol that could not be moved by dozens of men, signifying the Goddess‚Äôs divine presence and acceptance of her new abode.

From then, daily worship continued, with rituals that included recitation of verses from the Devi Mahatmya, offerings of red and black cloth, lemon garlands, and flowers. Regular cremation rites are conducted nearby for the salvation of departed souls‚Äîthe temple‚Äôs tradition as a "Hearse of Corpse" reflecting Chamunda‚Äôs role as the liberator from the fear of death.

For centuries, devotees from all over the land have journeyed to the Chamunda Devi Temple, especially during Navratri and Tuesdays, seeking her fierce protection and motherly blessings. Her temple is considered both a source of immense energy and compassion. Chamunda Devi‚Äôs presence in Kashi strengthens the spiritual shield of the city, making it not only a symbol of divine victory but also a center for deep seekers, yogis, and those treading the path of liberation.
