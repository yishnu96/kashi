## The Sacred Story

*── From Sthala Purana*

In the age described in Kāśī-khaṇḍa, a righteous king named Amitrajit, devoted to Lord Vishnu, welcomed Devarshi Narada to his palace and followed his counsel with unwavering dharma, setting in motion a destiny that would intertwine with Kashi’s Shakti-tattva through Devi Katyayani’s grace. Narada guided the king to rescue the noble Malayagandini from peril and to embrace her as queen, after which the royal couple journeyed to Kashi and settled by its sacred ghats, immersed in the city’s divine atmosphere where every sight is sanctified by Mahadeva’s presence. In due time, Malayagandini bore a son fated by cosmic alignment to be sixteen at birth, but dark omens at his nativity moved ministers to demand the unthinkable—sacrifice—in order to spare the king, a dilemma that pushed the queen toward the shelter of Kashi’s supreme Shakti-spheres.

Seeking a path that preserved both life and dharma, Malayagandini entrusted the boy to Vikata Devi within the Pancha Mudra Maha Peeth, the circle of mystic seals and motherly powers that anchors the Devi’s protective net in Kashi’s inner geography. Vikata Devi convened the Yoginis, emissaries of the Mother’s will, and sent them to present the child to the Matrika Devis for sanction, a heavenly council that perceived the boy’s innate divinity and returned him under Shakti’s protection, unmarked by the shadow of inauspiciousness. Returned to the Peeth, the youth engaged in deep prayer and tapas, a brief ascent into devaloka in consciousness and a return, demonstrating how Kashi opens doors between the worlds when Shakti and bhakti meet at a sanctified tirtha.

In the weaving of names and forms preserved by practitioners, Vikata Devi is honored here as Katyayani, the sixth form of Durga, whose golden effulgence and four-armed compassion bless the faithful with protection, fulfillment, and fearlessness, riding the lion as the sovereign Destroyer of Evil and Giver of Boons. The Purāṇas narrate her avatara as Mahishasura Mardini, manifest from the combined tejas of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva to end the tyranny of the buffalo-demon, an event celebrated across the land in Navratri’s sixth day when devotees seek unassailable strength and decisive victory in life’s battles. In this Kashi sthala, her presence is linked to the Pancha Mudra Maha Peeth, intensifying the fruit of worship and situating the shrine within a living mandala where every mantra and offering multiplies in potency through the Devi’s sanction.

The loveliness and intimacy of Katyayani’s grace also shines in the Bhagavatam’s Vraja-lila, where the kumārikās of Gokula perform a month-long vow on the Yamuna’s bank, offering simple, pure worship and chanting a mantra that has guided devotees for centuries: “kātyāyanī mahā-māye, mahā-yoginy adhīśvari; nanda-gopa-sutaṁ devi, patiṁ me kuru te namaḥ,” a prayer asking the Mother to grant Sri Krishna as their husband, revealing that Katyayani’s benediction joins martial victory with the sweetest fulfillment of the heart’s devotion. This vrata—marked by simplicity in diet, early-morning ablutions, and sustained japa—became the model for countless seekers who approach Katyayani for righteous companionship, life-direction, and the alignment of earthly duties with divine love, a practice still alive among devotees who visit Kashi during Navratri and other sacred windows. Thus, Katyayani here is both the radiant Mahishasuramardini of the battlefield and the tender Mother of vows, whose mantra bridges Rigvedic valor and Vrindavan’s madhurya on the soil of Avimukta Kshetra.

Within the Atma Veereshwar complex, her shrine inherits the sanctity of the surrounding linga-ksetra as described in Kashi Khanda, where even the simplest act of worship echoes across crores of lingas in merit and where those seeking progeny, protection, and prosperity find remedies anchored in scriptural precedent and lived tradition. The evening Special Aarti from 7:00–8:30 p.m. binds the day’s devotion into a lamp-lit offering of sound and light, a time when the narrow lanes swell with devotees and the Ganga-breeze carries mantra and bell-tones across Scindia Ghat, underlining Katyayani’s role as Kashi’s living Shakti who guards, heals, and uplifts. On the sixth day of Navratri—both Shardiya and Chaitra—the crowd grows dense as worshippers bring flowers, fruits, and simple prasad, while some observe the traditional haldi–dahi lepa to the Mother, a local sampradaya sign of invoking auspiciousness, purity, and protective warmth from the Devi’s hands.

The name “Katyayani” also honors Sage Katyayana, whose tapasya elicited the boon of the Devi’s birth as his daughter, anchoring the theology of proximity—how severe austerity and pure longing invite the Divine to arise from within one’s own lineage and life, turning the family itself into the Devi’s vehicle for dharma. In the Kashi landscape, this intimacy translates into practical vows, pilgrim discipline, and the counsel to consult the temple pujari for sankalpas, remedial rites, and special pujas, so every devotee’s need—health, marriage, progeny, courage—finds a rightful ritual channel in the Mother’s precinct. Such is the melody of Katyayani in Kashi: the fusion of Peethic power, Purāṇic story, and daily lamps, drawing seekers into a darshan where every step on the ghat and every syllable of japa becomes an axis of transformation
