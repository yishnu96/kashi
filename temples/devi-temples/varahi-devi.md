## The Sacred Story
In the cosmic realm where divine energies manifest to maintain universal balance, there emerged a time when the forces of darkness grew so powerful that even the gods trembled. The great demon Mahishasura, along with countless other asuras, had unleashed terror across all three worlds. Their evil had become so pervasive that even the sacred spaces were under threat.

Witnessing this cosmic crisis, the Divine Mother Durga prepared for the ultimate battle against these demonic forces. But she knew that this war would require not just her own divine power, but the combined strength of all sacred energies. From her divine breath, she created the Sapta Matrikas - the Seven Divine Mothers - each embodying a specific aspect of her infinite power.

Among these seven powerful goddesses emerged Varahi, born from the divine energy of Lord Vishnu's Varaha avatar. She manifested with the head of a boar, symbolizing the primal power that once lifted the Earth from the cosmic waters. Her form was both fierce and protective - her boar face representing the ability to root out evil from its deepest hiding places, just as a boar digs deep into the earth.

When Devi Durga began her cosmic battle, she appointed Varahi as her commander-in-chief. Varahi's strategic brilliance and fearsome power made her the perfect leader for the divine army. She could see through all illusions, detect enemies hidden in the darkest corners, and her thunderous war cry could shatter the confidence of even the mightiest demons.

During the great battle, while Durga fought the primary demons in daylight, Varahi took charge of the night operations. She realized that many evil spirits and lesser demons operated under the cover of darkness, spreading their malevolent influence when the world slept. These creatures of darkness would possess innocent beings, create nightmares, and fill people's hearts with fear and negativity.

Varahi made a sacred vow - she would patrol the night, ensuring that no evil force could operate in darkness without facing her wrath. Her boar form gave her extraordinary night vision and the ability to sense negative energies from vast distances. She became the eternal guardian of the night, the divine sentinel who never slumbers.

After the victory over Mahishasura and his army, the other Matrikas returned to their celestial abodes. But Varahi's work was not complete. She understood that the battle between good and evil is eternal, and darkness provides constant opportunity for negative forces to emerge.

It was then that she heard about Kashi, the city of light established by Lord Shiva himself. This sacred city was destined to be the spiritual capital of the world, where seekers would come to attain moksha. But such a holy place would naturally attract the attention of evil forces who would try to corrupt it.

Varahi descended to Kashi and chose to establish her eternal presence there. She selected a location near the sacred Ganga, where she could watch over the entire city. But being a tantric goddess of immense power, she knew that her direct presence would be too overwhelming for ordinary devotees to approach safely.

So she created her temple in the underground realm, symbolically representing the paataal lok - the nether world from where she could keep watch over all three worlds simultaneously. The underground location also signified her role as the guardian of hidden knowledge and the protector against subterranean evil forces.

She established a divine covenant with Lord Kala Bhairava, who had been appointed by Shiva as the Kotwal (administrator) of Kashi. They divided the responsibility - Kala Bhairava would guard the city during daylight hours when people were active and aware, while Varahi would take charge during the night when vulnerability was highest.

Every evening, as the sun sets, Varahi begins her patrol of Kashi. She travels through every street, every lane, every home, creating an invisible protective shield around the entire city. No ghost, no evil spirit, no negative entity can enter Kashi while she is on duty. Her presence ensures that the city's spiritual vibrations remain pure and that seekers can pursue their spiritual practices without fear of psychic interference.

Just before dawn, having completed her protective rounds, Varahi returns to her underground temple. The early morning hours, from 4 AM to 5:30 AM, are when the priests perform the sacred rituals to welcome her back. During this time, her divine energy is at its peak from the night's protective work, making these morning hours incredibly powerful for devotees seeking her blessings.

The two windows in her temple are not merely architectural features - they represent her eternal vigilance. Through one window, devotees can have darshan of her divine face, receiving her blessing and protection. Through the other, they can see her sacred feet, symbolizing surrender and seeking refuge under her divine guardianship.

The underground temple also became known as one of the 51 Shakti Peethas, where Sati's tooth had fallen during Shiva's tandava. This made Varahi's presence even more significant, as she became the guardian not just of Kashi, but of this sacred spot where the Divine Mother's power is permanently established.

Local traditions speak of countless instances where Varahi has intervened to protect devotees and the city itself. During times of plague, natural disasters, or external invasions, her protective presence has shielded Kashi from complete destruction. Even today, residents of Varanasi often speak of feeling an inexplicable sense of safety during the night hours, attributing this to Varahi's continued vigilance.

Her temple remains one of the most mysterious in Kashi - hidden from casual visitors, known only to true seekers and local devotees. This obscurity is intentional, as Varahi's energy is so intense that only those with genuine spiritual need and proper preparation should approach her sacred presence.
