Translation: "Chand Bhairav is the great guardian of the southern direction, the revered guru. He is three-eyed, blue-complexioned, and grants victory over enemies."

## History of the Mandir

The Chand Bhairav shrine exists within the ancient Kushmanda Durga Temple at Durga Kund, one of Varanasi's most significant religious complexes. The Durga Temple itself has been rebuilt multiple times throughout history, with the current structure dating to the 18th century during the Maratha period. The temple was constructed in the distinctive North Indian architectural style with its characteristic red sandstone facade.

The Ashta Bhairav temples, including Chand Bhairav, were established according to the Puranic tradition mentioned in the Kashi Khand, where eight forms of Bhairav were strategically placed across Kashi to serve as protective guardians. The specific placement of Chand Bhairav within the Durga Temple premises reflects the interconnected nature of Shakti and Shiva worship in Kashi tradition.

The temple has undergone various renovations over the centuries, with the current worship system being maintained by hereditary priests who follow ancient Tantric traditions. The murti of Chand Bhairav, carved in black stone, represents the traditional iconography described in the Puranas - a three-eyed, youthful form of Bhairava in a benevolent aspect.

## The Sacred Story
*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

In the cosmic scheme of divine protection, the story of Chand Bhairav begins with the great battle between the forces of good and evil that threatened the very fabric of creation. According to the sacred Kashi Khand, after Goddess Durga's victorious battle against the demon Durgasur, a profound transformation occurred in the spiritual landscape of Kashi.

The demon Dahurasuran had received a powerful boon from Lord Brahma that he could only be killed by a woman. Drunk with this seemingly invincible protection, Dahurasuran began terrorizing the three worlds, spreading chaos and darkness wherever his influence reached. The gods, led by Indra, found themselves powerless against this mighty asura who seemed beyond the reach of death itself.

Seeing the universe in peril, Lord Shiva consulted with his divine consort, Goddess Parvati. Understanding that only the divine feminine power could accomplish this task, Parvati invoked the fierce aspect of the cosmic mother - Ma Kali. From the third eye of Parvati emerged Kali in her most terrifying form, her dark complexion representing the void that exists before creation, her multiple arms wielding the weapons of cosmic justice.

The battle between Kali and Dahurasuran shook the foundations of existence. Kali's divine wrath was so intense that it manifested as pure energy, consuming the demon's evil completely. As Dahurasuran fell, his death released a tremendous burst of negative energy that threatened to contaminate the sacred realm.

But in that moment of victory, something extraordinary happened. Kali's infinite compassion transformed her wrath into nurturing love. The fierce energy that had destroyed the demon condensed into the form of a divine child - pure, innocent, yet possessing immense power. This child represented the transformation of destruction into protection, of anger into compassion.

Kali lovingly took the divine child in her arms and nursed him with her celestial milk, infusing him with the qualities of both fierce protection and gentle guidance. Lord Shiva, witnessing this beautiful transformation, decided to merge both Kali and the divine child within his cosmic consciousness.

From this sacred union of Shiva's transcendental awareness, Kali's protective power, and the child's pure energy, emerged Kaal Bhairav - the master of time and the supreme protector. But Kaal Bhairav's energy was so vast that it immediately manifested in eight distinct forms, each embodying different aspects of divine protection and spiritual guidance.

Chand Bhairav emerged as the third among these eight forms, representing the moon-like coolness that balances the fierce heat of spiritual transformation. While other forms of Bhairav might appear terrifying to inspire awe and discipline, Chand Bhairav manifested as a youthful, three-eyed deity with a blue complexion that radiated divine compassion.

His three eyes represent the past, present, and future - showing devotees that true victory comes from understanding the complete timeline of their spiritual journey. The first eye sees the karmic patterns from past lives that create current obstacles. The second eye perceives the present moment's opportunities for transformation. The third eye envisions the future liberation that awaits those who surrender to divine will.

Chand Bhairav's blue complexion carries deep symbolism. Blue represents the infinite sky of consciousness, the vastness that contains all experiences without being affected by them. It signifies the cool, calming presence that can soothe the burning effects of negative karma and competitive stress that devotees face in their worldly battles.

Lord Shiva appointed Chand Bhairav as the guardian of the southern direction, a position of great significance in Vedic cosmology. The south is associated with Yama, the lord of death and dharma, making it the direction where souls face their karmic reckonings. By placing Chand Bhairav in this direction, Shiva ensured that devotees would have a compassionate protector to guide them through their most challenging karmic lessons.

The sacred geography of Kashi was carefully planned by Lord Shiva himself. After creating the eight Bhairavas, he strategically placed them at different locations throughout the city to create a protective mandala of divine energy. Chand Bhairav was specifically placed within the sacred complex of Durga Temple because of the deep connection between Bhairav consciousness and Shakti power.

The Durga Temple location was chosen because it represents the triumph of divine feminine energy over demonic forces. By placing Chand Bhairav here, Shiva created a perfect synthesis where the protective power of the Divine Mother works in harmony with the guiding wisdom of Bhairav consciousness. Devotees who come here can access both the nurturing energy of Ma Durga and the strategic wisdom of Chand Bhairav.

The name "Chand" means moon, and like the moon that provides cool, gentle light in the darkness of night, Chand Bhairav provides soothing spiritual guidance to devotees struggling with the heat of competition and conflict in their lives. His energy is particularly beneficial for those facing rivals in business, education, or any field where they need to overcome opposition through righteous means.

Unlike the fierce forms of Bhairav that inspire fear in negative forces, Chand Bhairav attracts devotees through love and compassion. His youthful appearance represents the eternal renewal of spiritual energy - no matter how many defeats one has faced in the past, Chand Bhairav offers the fresh energy needed for new victories.

The installation of Chand Bhairav's murti within the Durga Temple complex was accomplished through a divine vision received by ancient sages. They were instructed to carve his form in black stone, representing the fertile darkness from which all creation emerges. The black color also symbolizes the absorption of negative energies - just as black absorbs all colors, Chand Bhairav absorbs all the negative influences that might harm his devotees.

His positioning next to Ma Kali's shrine is particularly significant. Ma Kali represents the fierce aspect of divine protection that destroys negative forces, while Chand Bhairav represents the nurturing aspect that builds positive energy in devotees. Together, they provide complete spiritual protection - removing obstacles and empowering success.

The tradition of Ashta Bhairav yatra developed as devotees realized the immense benefits of connecting with all eight forms of Bhairav energy. Starting with Chand Bhairav, pilgrims begin their journey with the blessing of compassionate guidance, which prepares them to face the more intense energies of the other Bhairav forms.

Chand Bhairav's special gift to devotees is the energy of righteous competition. In today's world, where people must compete in various fields, this blessing helps them maintain their dharmic principles while still achieving victory. His energy teaches that true success comes not from defeating others through deception or harmful means, but by elevating one's own capabilities to such a level that victory becomes natural and effortless.

The sacred presence of Chand Bhairav in Kashi continues to attract devotees from across the world who seek his blessings for overcoming challenges in their personal and professional lives. His compassionate energy transforms the anxiety of competition into the confidence of righteous action, ensuring that those who worship him with sincere hearts always find the strength to emerge victorious in their spiritual and worldly endeavors.
