## The Sacred Story 
*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

In the cosmic realms beyond mortal comprehension, after the divine Mother Durga accomplished her supreme mission of destroying the demon Durgasura, the very fabric of creation trembled with the aftermath of this celestial battle. The universe had witnessed the triumph of righteousness over evil, but the wise Mother knew that victory in battle was only the beginning of a greater responsibility.

Standing amidst the battlefield where dharma had prevailed, Devi Durga contemplated the sacred city of Kashi, the eternal abode of Lord Shiva, the city that exists beyond the cycles of creation and destruction. She understood that this holy city, being the very heart of spiritual consciousness on Earth, required constant protection from the forces of darkness that would forever seek to disturb its sanctity.

With her divine wisdom, the Mother resolved to create an eternal protective shield around Kashi. First, she manifested nine powerful shaktis, the Nava Durgas, positioning them strategically across different directions within the sacred city. These divine feminine energies would serve as the primary guardians of Kashi, ensuring that no negative force could penetrate the city's spiritual boundaries.

But the Mother's divine plan was even more comprehensive. Understanding that protection requires both the nurturing aspect of the Divine Feminine and the fierce protective aspect of the Divine Masculine, she decided to create eight powerful forms of Bhairava, the fierce manifestation of Lord Shiva himself. These eight Bhairavas would be positioned at crucial points throughout Kashi, each guarding a specific direction and providing protection against different types of spiritual and material obstacles.

As Devi Durga entered into deep meditation, her consciousness expanded to encompass all directions of space and time. From her divine being emerged eight magnificent forms of Bhairava, each embodying specific qualities needed to protect the holy city and its devotees. These were the **[Ashta Bhairava](/temples/tags/ashta-bhairav)**s - Ruru, Chand, Asitang, Krodhan, Kapal, Samhar, Unmatt, and Bheeshan.

Among these eight divine guardians, Asitang Bhairav emerged with unique characteristics that set him apart from his brothers. While other Bhairavas manifested with fierce and terrifying appearances meant to strike fear into the hearts of evil forces, Asitang Bhairav appeared with a remarkably peaceful and benevolent countenance. His skin was bright and radiant, almost luminous with divine grace, and his well-formed limbs spoke of perfect divine proportions.

The three eyes of Asitang Bhairav blazed with the wisdom of the past, present, and future. His central eye, the eye of divine knowledge, could perceive the deepest karmic patterns affecting his devotees. Unlike his more fierce brothers, Asitang carried his weapons - the Trishula (trident), Damaru (divine drum), and sword - not as instruments of destruction, but as tools of liberation and creative transformation.

Devi Durga assigned Asitang Bhairav the sacred responsibility of guarding the Eastern direction of Kashi. The East, being the direction of the rising sun, symbolizes new beginnings, hope, and the dawn of spiritual awakening. This was no coincidence - Asitang Bhairav was specifically created to help devotees overcome the darkness of their past karma and step into the light of creative spiritual expression.

The Mother blessed Asitang with a special power that distinguished him among his brothers. While all Bhairavas possessed the ability to protect devotees from external threats, Asitang received the unique blessing to relieve internal afflictions - the curses of past karma, the burden of accumulated negative actions, and the limitations that prevent souls from expressing their highest creative potential.

"My child," spoke Devi Durga to Asitang Bhairav, "you shall be known as the remover of afflictions and the awakener of creativity. Those who come to you with sincere hearts, burdened by the weight of their past actions or limited by their own self-imposed restrictions, shall find relief and liberation. You will not only protect them from external harm but will kindle within them the divine spark of creative expression that leads to spiritual evolution."

As the divine Mother established Asitang Bhairav in the eastern sector of Kashi, she chose a location that would resonate with his specific energies. The area around what would later become the Maha Mrityunjay Temple was selected, for this region held within its very soil the vibrations of overcoming death and limitation - perfectly aligned with Asitang's mission of liberating souls from the death-like grip of past karma.

The name "Asitang" itself carries profound meaning. "Asi" refers to the sword or blade, while "Ang" refers to the body or being. But in the case of this benevolent Bhairav, the sword represents not physical destruction but the cutting away of ignorance, limitations, and karmic bondage. His sword is the blade of discrimination that helps devotees distinguish between what serves their spiritual growth and what hinders it.

Once established in his sacred abode, Asitang Bhairav began his eternal vigil over Kashi and its spiritual seekers. Unlike some of his more austere brothers who demanded rigorous tapasya and fierce devotion, Asitang revealed himself to be remarkably approachable and compassionate. He understood that many souls seeking liberation were already weighed down by guilt, fear, and self-doubt, and needed gentle guidance rather than intimidating displays of divine power.

The first devotees to discover Asitang Bhairav were artists and craftsmen from ancient Kashi who found themselves blocked in their creative expressions. These souls, blessed with talent but hindered by past failures or societal limitations, approached the gentle Bhairav with offerings of their artistic works. To their amazement, Asitang not only accepted their humble offerings but blessed them with unprecedented creative breakthroughs.

Word of Asitang's special grace spread throughout Kashi and beyond. Poets whose words had dried up found their verses flowing like the sacred Ganga. Sculptors who had lost their touch discovered their hands guided by divine inspiration. Musicians whose melodies had become mere repetition suddenly found themselves channeling celestial ragas that moved both human hearts and divine beings.

But Asitang's blessings extended far beyond artistic creativity. He revealed that true creativity is the soul's natural expression of its divine nature, and this can manifest in any field of human endeavor. Merchants found innovative solutions to serve their communities better. Farmers discovered new ways to work in harmony with nature. Even simple householders found creative approaches to transforming their daily duties into spiritual practices.

The sages and spiritual teachers of Kashi recognized that Asitang Bhairav represented a unique aspect of divine grace - the understanding that spiritual liberation need not always come through severe austerities and renunciation. Through creative expression aligned with dharmic principles, souls could evolve and ultimately merge with the Divine.

Over the centuries, numerous miraculous events occurred at Asitang's shrine. Devotees reported visions of the gentle Bhairav appearing in their dreams, providing solutions to seemingly impossible problems. Artists received direct transmission of divine knowledge, enabling them to create works that elevated consciousness in all who experienced them.

One particularly famous account tells of a young sculptor who had been cursed by a rival to never complete any work successfully. No matter how skillfully he began, his creations would crack or break just before completion. In desperation, he approached Asitang Bhairav, offering his broken works and his tears of frustration.

Asitang appeared to him that very night, explaining that the curse was actually a blessing in disguise - it forced him to let go of attachment to results and focus purely on the divine love that should inspire all true art. The Bhairav taught him a special meditation technique to perform before beginning any work, connecting his creative energy directly to the divine source.

From that day forward, not only were the sculptor's works completed successfully, but they carried such spiritual power that people from distant lands would travel to Kashi just to witness his sculptures. The curse was not only broken but transformed into the greatest blessing of his life.

Such stories accumulated around Asitang Bhairav's shrine, establishing his reputation as the divine patron of all forms of creative expression. But perhaps more importantly, these accounts revealed his deeper teaching - that every limitation, every apparent curse, every obstacle in life contains within it the seed of greater grace if approached with the right understanding and devotion.

As the ages passed, the worship of Asitang Bhairav became integrated into the rich tapestry of Kashi's spiritual traditions. His shrine, nestled within the powerful energy field of the Maha Mrityunjay Temple, became a destination for souls seeking not just relief from suffering, but the positive transformation of their very nature.

The gentle Bhairav continues his eternal service, blessing all who approach him with sincere hearts. In the modern age, as humanity faces new forms of creative blocks and karmic challenges, Asitang Bhairav's relevance has only increased. He stands as a beacon of hope for all those who seek to transform their limitations into vehicles for divine expression, proving that the path to liberation can be walked with joy, creativity, and the constant companionship of divine grace.
