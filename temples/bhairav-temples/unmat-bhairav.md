## History of the Mandir

The Unmat Bhairav temple represents the culmination of the sacred Ashta Bhairav protective network established in Kashi according to the divine instructions found in the Kashi Khand. Its location in Deora Village along the Panch Kroshi Marg reflects the ancient understanding that the most profound spiritual experiences often occur away from worldly distractions in peaceful, natural settings.

The Panch Kroshi Parikrama route, which encompasses the temple's location, has been a sacred pilgrimage circuit for over a millennium. This 84-kilometer circumambulation of Kashi represents the complete spiritual journey from material consciousness to divine realization, making Unmat Bhairav's position on this route deeply significant as the final guardian experience in the Ashta Bhairav yatra.

The temple's remote location initially led to periods of neglect, but the divine power of Unmat Bhairav continuously attracted sincere devotees who recognized the profound spiritual energy present at this site. The recent complete renovation by a dedicated devotee demonstrates the continuing relevance and power of this sacred location.

The establishment of Unmat Bhairav in the western direction, associated with the setting sun and the transition from day to night, symbolizes the spiritual journey from ordinary consciousness into the divine darkness from which all enlightenment emerges. This positioning reflects ancient Tantric understanding of consciousness transformation.

The temple has maintained its traditional form of worship under the dedicated care of Shri Akhilesh Pandey and other local spiritual guardians who understand the unique significance of Unmat Bhairav's role in completing the devotee's journey through all eight aspects of divine protection and spiritual development.

## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

The magnificent story of Unmat Bhairav begins in the cosmic culmination of Ma Durga's victorious campaign against the forces of ignorance and evil, when the divine mother realized that her triumph required not just the destruction of negative forces, but the establishment of a permanent pathway for souls to transcend ordinary consciousness and achieve ultimate liberation. This narrative, preserved in the 72nd chapter of the Kashi Khand, reveals how divine grace operates through the principle of spiritual intoxication that dissolves all barriers between the individual soul and cosmic consciousness.

After Ma Durga had successfully vanquished the terrible demon Durgasur and established her nine protective Shaktis throughout Kashi, the cosmic mother contemplated the deeper challenge facing sincere spiritual seekers. While external protection and guidance could remove obstacles and provide direction, the ultimate goal of human existence - complete merger with divine consciousness - required a fundamentally different type of intervention.

Ma Durga understood that the highest spiritual states could not be achieved through ordinary effort or conventional practices alone. The ego-mind, no matter how purified and disciplined, would always maintain some sense of separate identity that prevented complete union with the infinite. The final barrier to liberation was not external evil or internal weakness, but the very structure of individual consciousness itself.

Contemplating this profound challenge, Ma Durga recognized that what was needed was a divine force that could induce the sacred madness of complete ego dissolution - a spiritual intoxication so powerful that all sense of separate selfhood would be completely dissolved in the ocean of cosmic consciousness. This divine madness would not be the confusion of mental illness, but the supreme clarity that comes when all limitations of individual identity are transcended.

With this cosmic insight, Ma Durga approached her eternal consort, Lord Shiva, with a request that would introduce the most transformative energy into the spiritual infrastructure of Kashi. She asked the great lord to manifest a form of his divine energy that could guide sincere seekers beyond all conventional spiritual practices into the ultimate state of divine intoxication where complete liberation becomes not just possible, but inevitable.

Lord Shiva, whose own nature embodies the perfect balance between transcendent awareness and divine ecstasy, immediately understood the profound wisdom of Parvati's request. In that moment of cosmic consultation, he began to contemplate how his protective energy could serve not just as a guardian against external threats, but as the ultimate catalyst for the complete transformation of human consciousness into divine consciousness.

From this profound meditation emerged Unmat Bhairav - the divine embodiment of sacred madness whose very presence induces the spiritual intoxication that dissolves all barriers between the individual soul and infinite reality. The name "Unmat" derives from the Sanskrit root meaning "beyond mind" or "transcending ordinary consciousness," indicating a state where normal mental categories and limitations no longer apply.

As Unmat Bhairav took form, his appearance reflected the unique nature of his cosmic mission as the ultimate liberating force. Unlike the protective or educational aspects of other Bhairavas, Unmat manifested as a peaceful, bright-complexioned deity whose very presence radiates the serene bliss that comes from complete transcendence of all worldly concerns and spiritual seeking itself.

His bright, luminous complexion represents the clear light of consciousness that remains when all mental modifications and ego identifications have been dissolved. This divine radiance is not the reflection of any external light, but the self-luminous nature of pure awareness that becomes visible when all obscurations have been removed through the process of divine intoxication.

His three eyes carry the most profound significance for ultimate spiritual realization. The first eye perceives all the spiritual practices and purifications that a soul has undertaken throughout countless lifetimes of seeking. The second eye sees the subtle ego attachments and spiritual pride that can persist even in advanced seekers, preventing final liberation. The third eye - the eye of divine grace - induces the sacred madness that instantly dissolves all remaining traces of individual identity.

The peaceful, youthful appearance of Unmat Bhairav teaches that ultimate spiritual realization is not a grim struggle or painful sacrifice, but the most natural and joyful experience possible for human consciousness. His youthful energy represents the eternal freshness of divine awareness that never ages, never becomes stale, and continuously discovers itself as if for the first time.

In his four divine hands, Unmat Bhairav carries the essential implements for inducing complete spiritual transformation. The sword (Khadga) represents the sharp discrimination that cuts through all illusions of separateness. The skull (Kapala) symbolizes the death of ego identity that must occur for divine realization to emerge. The pestle (Mudgara) represents the grinding away of all subtle mental impressions and karmic seeds. The shield (Khetaka) symbolizes the protection from all forms of spiritual regression once ultimate realization has been achieved.

His divine mount, the swan (Hamsa), carries the deepest symbolism for the soul's journey toward liberation. The swan represents the Paramahamsa consciousness - the supreme soul that has learned to separate the eternal from the temporary, the real from the illusory. Just as a swan can separate milk from water, the enlightened consciousness guided by Unmat Bhairav can distinguish between the permanent reality of divine consciousness and the temporary appearances of worldly experience.

Lord Shiva appointed Unmat Bhairav as the guardian of the West direction, a positioning that carries profound significance for the final stages of spiritual development. The West represents the direction of the setting sun, the daily death that precedes rebirth, the dissolution that allows for renewal. By placing Unmat in this direction, Shiva created a cosmic gateway where souls could experience the death of ego consciousness and the birth of divine awareness.

This directional assignment also reflects the natural progression of spiritual development. The West is traditionally associated with the completion of cycles, the fulfillment of destinies, and the preparation for new beginnings. Unmat Bhairav's presence in this direction ensures that devotees who have completed their journey through the other seven aspects of divine protection and guidance can now transcend the very need for protection and guidance itself.

The choice of location for Unmat Bhairav's temple in the remote Deora Village, away from the busy spiritual activity of central Kashi, reflects the understanding that ultimate realization requires a temporary withdrawal from all external spiritual supports and practices. The isolated location creates the perfect environment for the inward journey that leads beyond all forms of seeking to the discovery of what was never lost.

The positioning along the Panch Kroshi Marg, the great circumambulation route of Kashi, symbolizes the completion of all spiritual journeys. Devotees who reach Unmat Bhairav have symbolically completed not just the circuit of Kashi's sacred geography, but the entire cycle of spiritual development from initial seeking to ultimate realization.

The legend describes how Unmat Bhairav, upon manifesting in this remote location, immediately began demonstrating his unique power to induce the divine madness that leads to complete liberation. Unlike other forms of spiritual intervention that work gradually through practices and purifications, Unmat's approach involves the direct transmission of transcendent consciousness that can instantly dissolve years or lifetimes of spiritual seeking.

His method of blessing devotees reflects the principle that ultimate realization cannot be achieved through any form of effort or practice, but only through the direct grace that dissolves the very one who would make effort or engage in practice. This paradoxical approach - the destruction of the seeker to reveal what was always already present - represents the highest form of spiritual transmission.

The sacred tradition describes numerous instances where devotees who had exhausted all conventional spiritual practices and felt themselves still separated from divine realization found instant transformation after sincerely surrendering to Unmat Bhairav's energy. These transformations typically manifested not as gradual improvements in spiritual condition, but as sudden, complete shifts in the very center of identity from individual consciousness to cosmic awareness.

The cosmic principle behind Unmat Bhairav's power lies in his direct embodiment of the Unmani state - the condition of consciousness beyond all mental modifications where pure awareness recognizes its own infinite nature. When sincere seekers connect with Unmat's energy, they are not receiving something new, but having the veils removed from what they have always been.

The temple's specialization in destroying harmful negative influences reflects Unmat's unique understanding that the most subtle and persistent negative influence is the ego mind itself. While other protective deities might guard against external threats or internal weaknesses, Unmat addresses the root cause of all suffering - the illusion of separate individual existence.

The association with Varahi Matrika, his divine consort, represents the perfect integration of transcendent awareness (masculine principle) and dynamic manifestation (feminine principle) that characterizes the highest spiritual realization. This divine union demonstrates that ultimate liberation does not reject or transcend the world, but recognizes the world as the playful expression of consciousness itself.

The traditional worship of Unmat Bhairav involves approaches designed to help devotees release all spiritual effort and surrender into the natural state of divine intoxication that is always available. The most important element is the willingness to die to all spiritual seeking and ego achievement, allowing the divine madness to dissolve all traces of the seeker.

The temple's location away from conventional pilgrimage circuits attracts primarily those devotees who have become genuinely tired of all spiritual practice and seeking, and are ready for the final surrender that ends the spiritual journey by revealing that there was never anywhere to go or anything to achieve.

The flexible worship timing reflects Unmat's understanding that ultimate realization transcends all forms of ritual structure and prescribed practice. Devotees are encouraged to approach when they feel genuinely called by the energy of transcendence, rather than following any external schedule or obligation.

The contemporary relevance of Unmat Bhairav's energy has perhaps never been greater. In today's spiritual marketplace, where countless practices, teachers, and techniques promise liberation while often creating more subtle forms of spiritual materialism and ego enhancement, Unmat represents the direct path that bypasses all intermediate steps.

His blessings are particularly sought by advanced practitioners who have exhausted conventional spiritual approaches, those experiencing the "dark night of the soul" where all previous spiritual supports have lost their meaning, and anyone ready for the complete surrender that ends all spiritual seeking in the recognition of what was never absent.

The key to receiving his grace lies in approaching him with complete spiritual exhaustion - the recognition that all efforts to achieve realization have failed and that only divine intervention can dissolve the fundamental illusion of separate existence. This is not a depression or despair, but the mature recognition that the ego can never achieve what it seeks because the seeker itself is the obstacle to realization.

The sacred presence of Unmat Bhairav in the remote outskirts of Kashi serves as the final destination for souls who have completed their journey through all forms of spiritual practice and protection, and are ready for the ultimate gift - the dissolution of the one who would receive any gift into the infinite generosity of existence itself.

His energy teaches that the highest spiritual realization is not an achievement or attainment, but a recognition of what was always already the case - that individual consciousness has never been separate from cosmic consciousness, and all spiritual practice has been the elaborate play of consciousness seeking itself.

In the sacred geography of Kashi, where every temple and practice serves the ultimate purpose of guiding souls toward liberation, Unmat Bhairav represents the final doorway through which seeking ends and being begins. His presence assures devotees that no matter how long their spiritual journey has been, how many practices they have tried, or how many obstacles they have faced, the ultimate realization is always available through the simple surrender into the divine madness that dissolves all problems by dissolving the one who would have problems.

The completion of the Ashta Bhairav yatra at Unmat's shrine symbolizes not just the end of a pilgrimage, but the end of all pilgrimage - the recognition that what was sought through traveling to sacred places was never absent from any place, and what was pursued through spiritual practice was never other than the one who was practicing.
