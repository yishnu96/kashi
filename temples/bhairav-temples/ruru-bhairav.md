Translation: "Ruru Bhairav is the divine guru who bestows knowledge and learning. He is three-eyed, fair-complexioned, and guardian of the South-North direction. Holding veena and book in his hands, adorned with gem-studded ornaments, he is the Supreme Lord who grants mastery in all forms of knowledge to his devotees."

## History of the Mandir

The Ruru Bhairav temple represents one of the most ancient centers of learning and wisdom worship in Kashi, with its establishment rooted in the Puranic traditions described in the Kashi Khand. The temple's location near Hanuman Ghat and Harishchandra Ghat reflects the profound spiritual geography of Varanasi, where knowledge and liberation are intimately connected.

The area around Hanuman Ghat has been historically significant as a place where sages and scholars gathered to discuss philosophical matters while contemplating the eternal cycle of life and death visible at the nearby cremation ghat. The positioning of Ruru Bhairav's shrine in this location was specifically designed to help devotees understand that true knowledge comes from recognizing the transient nature of worldly existence.

The temple structure has evolved over centuries, with the current modest form reflecting the simple, accessible nature of divine wisdom that Ruru Bhairav represents. Unlike more elaborate temple complexes, this shrine maintains the humble appearance that encourages devotees to focus on internal transformation rather than external grandeur.

Historical records indicate that the temple has been continuously patronized by students, scholars, and artists throughout different periods of Indian history. During the medieval period, when Kashi served as a major center of Sanskrit learning, the Ruru Bhairav temple became a popular destination for students seeking divine blessings before important examinations or scholarly debates.

The tradition of worshipping Ruru Bhairav as Guru Bhairav developed from the understanding that all true knowledge ultimately flows from divine sources. The temple has maintained this emphasis on the guru-disciple relationship, with many devotees considering Ruru Bhairav as their spiritual teacher who guides them toward both worldly success and spiritual enlightenment.

## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

The magnificent story of Ruru Bhairav begins in the cosmic realm where divine consciousness contemplates the eternal challenge of imparting wisdom to countless souls across multiple dimensions of existence. According to the sacred Kashi Khand, this narrative unfolds in the aftermath of Ma Durga's victory over the demon Durgasur, when the cosmic balance required not just protection, but the active cultivation of knowledge and wisdom among devotees.

After Ma Durga had successfully vanquished the terrible demon Durgasur, whose name had become synonymous with obstacles to spiritual and intellectual growth, the divine mother recognized a profound truth about the nature of lasting victory over ignorance and evil. Physical defeat of negative forces, while necessary, was only the first step in establishing a sustainable spiritual civilization.

Ma Durga understood that true protection of Kashi and its devotees required not just the removal of external threats, but the positive cultivation of knowledge, wisdom, and spiritual discrimination among all who sought shelter in the sacred city. Ignorance, she realized, was the root cause that allowed negative forces to gain influence over human consciousness in the first place.

With this cosmic insight, Ma Durga approached her eternal consort, Lord Shiva, with a request that would fundamentally transform the spiritual landscape of Kashi. She asked the great lord to manifest protective energies that would not only guard against external threats, but actively nurture the growth of wisdom and knowledge among devotees, ensuring they would develop the spiritual discrimination needed to avoid future entanglement with negative forces.

Lord Shiva, whose infinite consciousness encompasses all forms of knowledge from the grossest material sciences to the most subtle spiritual realizations, immediately understood the profound wisdom of Parvati's request. In that cosmic moment, he began to contemplate how his protective energy could simultaneously serve as a fountain of divine wisdom for sincere seekers.

From this divine contemplation emerged the concept of the Ashta Bhairav - eight distinct manifestations of Shiva's protective consciousness, each specializing in different aspects of spiritual development and practical guidance. But among these eight, one would embody the pure essence of divine teaching and knowledge transmission.

Ruru Bhairav emerged as the second among these cosmic guardians, manifesting directly from Lord Shiva's aspect as Adi Guru - the primordial teacher from whom all knowledge flows. Unlike the fierce protective energy of some other Bhairavas, Ruru embodied the gentle, nurturing aspect of divine wisdom that guides seekers with patience, compassion, and infinite understanding.

The name "Ruru" carries deep symbolic meaning in Sanskrit tradition. It can be interpreted as the combination of "Ru" meaning "to cry" or "to call," reflecting how divine wisdom calls out to souls ready for spiritual education. The repetition "Ru-Ru" symbolizes the continuous, persistent nature of divine teaching - always available, always calling, never giving up on even the most seemingly hopeless student.

Another interpretation suggests that "Ruru" represents the sound made by the cosmic cow of wisdom, whose milk nourishes the spiritual development of sincere seekers. Just as a mother cow calls to her calf with loving concern, Ruru Bhairav calls to devotees with the compassionate urgency of divine love, eager to share the nectar of spiritual knowledge.

As Ruru Bhairav took form, his appearance reflected the unique nature of his cosmic mission as the divine guru. Unlike the more austere or fierce aspects of Bhairav, Ruru manifested as a fair-complexioned, youthful deity whose very appearance radiated the joy and beauty of divine knowledge. His fair complexion represents the pure, unstained nature of divine wisdom - knowledge that illuminates rather than confuses, liberates rather than binds.

His three eyes carry profound educational significance. The first eye perceives the current level of understanding and capability of each devotee, meeting them exactly where they are in their spiritual journey. The second eye sees the karmic patterns and past-life learning that have brought the soul to its current state of readiness. The third eye - the eye of divine wisdom - perceives the perfect teaching methods and spiritual practices that will guide each individual soul toward complete enlightenment.

The peaceful, youthful appearance of Ruru Bhairav teaches that true knowledge never ages or becomes obsolete. Divine wisdom remains eternally fresh, eternally relevant, eternally capable of providing exactly the guidance needed for contemporary challenges. His youthful energy represents the perpetual enthusiasm that divine consciousness brings to the task of teaching and guiding souls.

In his four divine hands, Ruru Bhairav holds the essential tools of spiritual education. The rosary (akshamala) represents the systematic, disciplined approach required for spiritual learning - the patient repetition of practice that gradually transforms consciousness. Each bead represents a lesson learned, a realization integrated, a step forward on the path of wisdom.

The book (pustaka) in his hand symbolizes the vast repository of divine knowledge contained in sacred scriptures, philosophical treatises, and spiritual instructions. But this is not merely intellectual knowledge - it represents the living wisdom that transforms understanding into direct realization.

The veena, the divine musical instrument, represents the harmonious integration of all forms of knowledge. Just as the veena produces beautiful music through the proper coordination of strings, rhythm, and melody, spiritual wisdom creates a harmonious life through the proper integration of knowledge, devotion, and practical action.

The elephant goad (ankusha) symbolizes the gentle but firm guidance needed to direct the mind away from distracting thoughts and toward focused spiritual practice. Like a mahout guiding an elephant with loving authority, Ruru Bhairav guides devotees' consciousness toward higher realization.

Lord Shiva appointed Ruru Bhairav as the guardian of the South-North direction, a positioning that carries profound significance in the spiritual geography of knowledge transmission. The South represents the realm of ancestral wisdom and traditional learning - the vast accumulated knowledge of previous generations of realized souls. The North represents the direction of new discoveries, fresh insights, and innovative approaches to eternal truths.

By positioning Ruru Bhairav as guardian of this South-North axis, Shiva ensured that devotees would have access to both traditional wisdom and contemporary insights, both time-tested spiritual practices and innovative applications suitable for modern circumstances. Ruru Bhairav serves as the divine bridge between ancient knowledge and present-day application.

The choice of location for Ruru Bhairav's temple near Hanuman Ghat, adjacent to Harishchandra Ghat, reflects a profound understanding of the relationship between knowledge and the ultimate reality of death and liberation. The proximity to one of Kashi's primary cremation sites creates a unique spiritual environment where the pursuit of knowledge is constantly informed by the awareness of life's temporary nature.

This strategic positioning teaches devotees that all learning, whether spiritual or worldly, gains its ultimate meaning and urgency from the recognition that human life is precious and limited. The sight and sounds of the cremation activities serve as a constant reminder that knowledge pursued merely for ego gratification or material accumulation ultimately leads to frustration, while knowledge sought for spiritual liberation leads to eternal fulfillment.

The presence of Hanuman Temple nearby adds another dimension to the spiritual education provided by Ruru Bhairav. Hanuman represents the ideal student - completely devoted, utterly humble, infinitely capable of service, and permanently committed to the guru-disciple relationship. Devotees visiting Ruru Bhairav naturally absorb these qualities of ideal studentship.

The legend describes how Ruru Bhairav, upon establishing his presence in Kashi, immediately began attracting students, scholars, and seekers of wisdom from across the known world. His unique gift was the ability to adapt his teaching style to the specific needs, capabilities, and circumstances of each individual devotee.

For highly intellectual seekers, he would provide sophisticated philosophical insights and complex spiritual practices that challenged their analytical abilities while guiding them toward direct experience. For simple, devotional souls, he would offer heart-opening practices and devotional approaches that suited their natural temperament. For practical individuals focused on worldly success, he would teach the integration of spiritual principles with material activities.

His teaching methodology reflected the understanding that divine wisdom is not a one-size-fits-all commodity, but a living, dynamic force that manifests differently according to the readiness and nature of each recipient. This personalized approach made Ruru Bhairav accessible to devotees from all backgrounds and levels of spiritual development.

The sacred tradition describes numerous instances where students facing seemingly impossible academic challenges - whether in traditional Sanskrit learning, artistic development, or practical skills - found miraculous transformation after sincerely connecting with Ruru Bhairav's grace. But these miracles typically manifested not as external interventions, but as sudden clarity of understanding, enhanced memory and comprehension, or breakthrough insights that revolutionized the student's approach to learning.

Ruru Bhairav's special gift lies in awakening the natural learning capacity that already exists within each soul. Rather than simply providing information from outside, he activates the divine intelligence that is the true source of all knowledge and creativity. This approach ensures that devotees develop genuine understanding rather than mere intellectual accumulation.

The epithet "Anand Bhairav" - the Blissful Bhairav - reveals another crucial aspect of his teaching approach. Ruru demonstrates that true learning should be a joyful, expansive experience rather than a struggle or burden. When knowledge flows from divine sources and is received with the proper attitude of devotion and service, the learning process itself becomes a source of profound happiness and spiritual fulfillment.

This joyful approach to knowledge distinguishes divine education from mere intellectual gymnastics. Students who connect with Ruru Bhairav's energy find that their studies become increasingly effortless and enjoyable, not because the material becomes easier, but because they develop the inner capacities needed to receive and integrate knowledge with grace and efficiency.

The title "Guru Bhairav" reflects his role as the archetypal spiritual teacher who embodies all the qualities of the perfect guru. He demonstrates infinite patience with slow students, appropriate challenge for advanced seekers, unwavering commitment to each devotee's spiritual development, and the wisdom to provide exactly the right teaching at exactly the right moment.

His relationship with Maheshwari Matrika, his divine consort, represents the perfect integration of knowledge (masculine principle) and wisdom (feminine principle). While Ruru provides the content and structure of learning, Maheshwari provides the intuitive understanding and practical application that transforms information into lived wisdom.

The sacred bull (Rishaba) that serves as Ruru Bhairav's mount symbolizes the strength, stability, and reliability required for serious spiritual education. Just as a bull provides the steady power needed for agriculture, spiritual learning requires the sustained effort and commitment that can only come from genuine devotion and disciplined practice.

The positioning of Ruru Bhairav as the second in the Ashta Bhairav sequence reflects the understanding that once devotees have received initial protection and guidance, their next need is for the knowledge and wisdom that will enable them to make continued progress on the spiritual path. Knowledge without protection can lead to spiritual pride, while protection without knowledge can lead to spiritual dependency.

The contemporary relevance of Ruru Bhairav's energy has perhaps never been greater. In today's information age, people are often overwhelmed by the sheer volume of available knowledge while simultaneously struggling with the lack of genuine wisdom and practical guidance for making important life decisions.

Ruru Bhairav's blessings are particularly sought by students preparing for examinations, professionals seeking career advancement, artists developing their creative abilities, and anyone who needs enhanced mental clarity and learning capacity. His energy is especially beneficial for those who struggle with memory problems, concentration difficulties, or learning disabilities.

The key to receiving his grace lies in approaching him with the attitude of a genuine student - humble, eager to learn, willing to practice consistently, and committed to using acquired knowledge for the benefit of others rather than merely personal advancement.

The sacred presence of Ruru Bhairav in Kashi continues to serve countless devotees who come seeking not just information or skills, but the divine wisdom that transforms knowledge into enlightenment. His energy teaches that the ultimate purpose of all learning is to develop the spiritual discrimination needed to distinguish between the temporary and the eternal, the meaningful and the trivial, the path of liberation and the path of bondage.

In the sacred geography of Kashi, where every street corner offers opportunities for spiritual education and every temple provides lessons in divine wisdom, Ruru Bhairav stands as the cosmic reminder that all genuine knowledge ultimately flows from the same divine source - the infinite consciousness of Lord Shiva that manifests as both the teacher and the taught, the knowledge and the knower, the path and the goal of all authentic spiritual education.
