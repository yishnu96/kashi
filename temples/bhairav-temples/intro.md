# Bhairavas of Kashi
 *── Divine Guardians You Must Know*

When you step into the ancient lanes of Varanasi, you're walking through a city protected by fierce divine guardians called Bhairavas. These aren't just temple deities—they're the spiritual security force of Kashi, with Kala Bhairava himself serving as the city's chief protector or "Kotwal."

## Who Are the Bhairavas?

Think of Bhairavas as Shiva's most powerful and protective forms. The very name "Bhairava" comes from "bhī" meaning fear—but here's the beautiful paradox: while their appearance might seem terrifying, they actually remove fear from your life. These divine guardians protect sacred spaces, deliver swift justice, and are often depicted with loyal dogs as their companions.

In Kashi, you'll find nine Bhairavas strategically positioned across the city like spiritual sentinels, each guarding different directions and neighborhoods.

## The Divine Origin Story

Here's how the scriptures tell it: Once, Lord Brahma's ego grew too large, so Shiva manifested Bhairava from his own forehead to teach him humility. Bhairava cut off Brahma's fifth head, and the skull stuck to his hand as punishment for this act.

Bhairava wandered the earth carrying this burden until he reached Kashi. Here, at the sacred spot called Kapal Mochan, the skull finally fell away, freeing him from the sin. This is why Kala Bhairava chose Kashi as his eternal seat of power, becoming the city's divine guardian.

Later, to further protect Kashi after Devi's victory over the demon Durgasura, eight more Bhairavas were established around the city, creating a protective spiritual shield.
