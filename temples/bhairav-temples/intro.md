## Puranic Stories

### Origin of Kaal Bhairav
According to **Shiva Purana** and other ancient texts, the emergence of Kaal Bhairav occurred during a cosmic dispute:[2][6][4]

**The Divine Conflict**: When Lord Brahma and Vishnu argued about their supremacy, both claiming to be superior to the other. During this heated debate, **Brahma made derogatory remarks about Lord Shiva**.[6][2]

**The Fiery Pillar**: A massive **Agni Stambha (fiery pillar)** emerged between them, challenging both to find its beginning or end. Brahma took the form of a swan (Hamsa) and flew upward, while Vishnu became a boar (Varaha) and went downward.[6]

**Brahma's Deception**: When Brahma found a **Ketaki flower** during his ascent, he conspired with it to falsely claim he had reached the pillar's top.[6]

**Kaal Bhairav's Manifestation**: Enraged by Brahma's lie, **Lord Shiva manifested as the fierce Kaal Bhairav** and **severed Brahma's fifth head** with his nail in a single strike.[6]

**The Curse of Brahma Hatya**: The severed head stuck to Bhairav's hand as a curse of **Brahma Hatya (sin of killing Brahma)**. Shiva instructed Bhairav to wander the universe until the head would fall off naturally.[6]

**Liberation in Kashi**: After wandering across the cosmos for eons, the head finally fell off when Bhairav reached **Kashi**, liberating him from the sin. Since then, **Kaal Bhairav has remained the eternal guardian of Kashi**.[2]

## Ashta Bhairav (Eight Bhairavas)

### Legend of Ashta Bhairav Creation
According to **Kashi Khanda of Skanda Purana**:[7]
- **Devi Durga** created eight Bhairavas after killing the demon Durgasura
- These **eight protective deities** were established across Kashi to guard the sacred city in different directions[7]
- They work alongside the **Nava Durgas** to protect pilgrims and residents[7]
