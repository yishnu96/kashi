# Adi Keshav

Adi Keshav stands at the sacred confluence of the Ganga and Varuna, where Lord Vishnu first set foot in Kashi, making it the first and foremost Vishnutirtha of the city as described in Kashi Khanda and noted in the Matsya Purana tradition for this ghat‚Äôs sanctity. The temple houses Adi Keshav alongside Sangameshwar, a four-faced linga installed by Adi Keshav, and grants moksha, happiness, and relief from sorrow through darshan and worship here.

    To the north of Vedeshwar stands Adi Keshav; by beholding Him, one surely attains the merit of beholding all the three worlds.

## History of the Mandir

- Mentioned in Kashi Khanda as the original arrival place of Lord Vishnu in Kashi, with the site known as Padodaka Tirtha at the Varuna‚ÄìGanga confluence.
- Ancient prominence through the Gahadavala era when Rajghat served as a capital zone; rulers performed snan and dana here after bathing at Adi Keshav Ghat.
- The temple suffered destruction under Qutb-ud-din Aibak in 1194 CE and was later restored under the Gwalior (Scindia) state, with Diwan Madho credited for reconstruction.
- Post-1857, the complex was used as a British outpost; pipes and apertures in walls remain as markers of that phase.
- The present layout includes the shrine of Adi Keshav and Sangameshwar, with architecture noted as distinct from typical local styles and set on a high terrace at the Sangam-side plateau.

## The Sacred Story

_‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana_

Kashi Khanda records that Lord Shiva, at Brahma‚Äôs request, once left Kashi for Mount Mandara. King Divodasa was then enthroned in Kashi, and he ruled with such righteousness that no fault could be found. Desiring to restore Shiva to His city, Lord Vishnu entered Kashi as Shiva‚Äôs emissary and first touched the holy ground at this very Sangam. He sanctified the confluence as Padodaka Tirtha, where He also bathed, establishing the first Vishnu presence in Kashi.

At this spot, Vishnu manifested as Adi Keshav, carving His own murti as stated in the Skanda Purana. He consecrated the site as the primal Vishnutirtha of Kashi, where darshan brings the fruits of beholding the three worlds and grants moksha. Adi Keshav also installed Sangameshwar, a four-faced linga, so that seekers could honor both Shiva and Vishnu. This northern threshold of the city is revered as the feet of Kashi‚Äôs sacred body.

As ages passed, Adi Keshav remained a central tirtha where Gahadavala kings bathed and offered charity. The temple retains the serene current of that original arrival, where a devotee‚Äôs sadness is cleansed and joy arises by worshipping Adi Keshav and completing the darshan at Sangameshwar.
