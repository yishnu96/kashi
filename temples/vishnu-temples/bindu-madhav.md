## History of the Mandir

* The original, grand Bindu Madhav temple at Panchganga Ghat was famed in early accounts and later suffered destruction under Aurangzeb, who ordered a mosque to be built at the site.
* Travelers like Jean-Baptiste Tavernier described the old temple‚Äôs grandeur and the richly adorned deity prior to its demolition.
* The present shrine near the Alamgiri Mosque area emerged in the 19th century under Maratha patron Bhawan Rao, continuing the uninterrupted worship of Bindu Madhav.
* Today the sanctum is housed in a simple hall in the lanes above Panchganga Ghat, with the deity venerated as Saligram Shila by devotees.

## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

When King Divodasa held Kashi under strict dharma where even gods did not freely manifest, Mahadev directed Lord Vishnu to arrive from Mandarachal to accomplish the divine task of moving Divodasa from Kashi for the restoration of cosmic order. After completing this mission, Lord Vishnu stayed to relish the sanctity of Kashi and walked the holy teerths‚ÄîPancha Nada Teerth and Padodak Teerth‚Äîwhere tapasya filled the air with sacred vibration. At Pancha Nada Teerth, he met the emaciated sage Agni Bindu immersed in austere penance, whose heart overflowed on seeing the Lord and who sang His names‚ÄîMukunda, Madhusudan, Madhav, Narayan, Ramabhadra, Chaturbhuj, Janardhan.

Pleased, Lord Vishnu asked Agni Bindu Rishi to seek a boon, and the sage asked only for the Lord‚Äôs eternal presence at Pancha Nada Teerth, so that the kshetra would forever be blessed. The Lord granted this boon, proclaiming that Kashi rests upon the Trishul of Mahadev, untouched even by Mahapralaya, and that He would remain here for as long as Kashi endures. Agni Bindu Rishi further prayed that those who bathe at Pancha Nada Teerth and worship the Lord would gain wealth, prosperity, and‚Äîif they bathed and worshipped in Kartik‚Äîattain moksha even if death occurred elsewhere.

Lord Vishnu then declared His name and form here as Bindu Madhav, sanctifying the waters as Bindu Teerth, and revealing that in Sat Yuga He is Adi Madhav, in Treta Yuga Ananda Madhav, in Dvapara Yuga Shree Madhav, and in Kali Yuga He is present as Bindu Madhav. Kashi Khand states that during Kartik, even Lord Vishweshwar bathes in this teerth daily, affirming the unrivaled sanctity of Panchganga Ghat and the power of bathing and worshipping here. Thus, the vrata of Kartik snan and Tulsi-seva to Bindu Madhav became the core sadhana of this mandir, binding Vishnu-bhakti, teerth-snana, and the blessing of liberation into one direct path for devotees in Kashi.
