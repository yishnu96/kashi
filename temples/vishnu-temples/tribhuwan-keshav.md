## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

Kashi Khand establishes the cosmic mandate that Lord Vishnu abides across Kashi in many Keshava and Madhava forms, each fixed to a precise tirtha to bestow liberation and fullness of life in direct, embodied darshan. After the divine re-ordering of Kashi‚Äôs sacred map, the Lord set Himself as Tribhuwan Keshav to the south of Trilokya Sundari Bandi Devi, announcing an irrevocable boon: the worshipper of Tribhuwan Keshav does not enter the womb again. This is the Lord‚Äôs moksha-vrata encoded into Kashi‚Äôs lanes and ghats, binding the city‚Äôs pilgrim steps to the eternal law of grace.

In the age when the devas and rishis sought a city where dharma would be unbroken, the luminous Kashi rose on the bank of the Ganga as Shiva‚Äôs own kshetra and Vishnu‚Äôs assured refuge. Vishnu declared that He would not merely bless from afar but remain accessible in Kashi through specific murtis placed at spiritually charged points, so that a devotee‚Äôs walk across the city would become a pilgrimage through the Lord‚Äôs living body. Thus the Keshava lineages‚ÄîAdi Keshav at Padodaka Tirtha, Bindu Madhav above Panchganga, and the many Keshava-Madhava presences in between‚Äîcompose a garland of Vishnu‚Äôs grace around Shiva‚Äôs city. In this sanctified garland, Tribhuwan Keshav is the knot of moksha south of Trilokya Sundari, where the cycle of birth loosens its hold.

Bandi Devi, the Trilokya Sundari, stands as the Mother whose beauty pervades the three worlds; near Her southern reach, the Lord takes the name Tribhuwan Keshav‚ÄîKeshava who sustains the three worlds, pacifies the three afflictions, and dissolves the three knots of bondage. The divine instruction is simple and direct: fold the hands, offer tulsi, and bow here; the soul is no longer pulled back to the womb. The Puranic assurance is not metaphor; it is the law of Kashi where darshan equals destiny, and where a single step aligned with injunction becomes a lifetime of sadhana fulfilled.

Pilgrims walking from Godowlia to Dashashwamedh enter an ancient theatre of worship. The smell of flowers, the clamour of sabzis in the bazaar, and the sudden stillness of a small sanctum behind a grilled door all belong to the same sacred script: Kashi offers immediacy. Here, Tribhuwan Keshav is near enough to touch and yet distant enough to be revered, allowing the heart to settle, the breath to soften, and the mantra ‚ÄúOm Namo Narayanaya‚Äù to find its natural rhythm. In the morning, the pujari‚Äôs lamp circles the Lord‚Äôs form; the light stains the brass and stone, and the promise of the Kashi Khand takes life in a space barely the size of a room. The Lord who spans the three worlds accepts a tulsi leaf and grants freedom beyond number and measure.

Kashi‚Äôs Vishnu-tantra is deliberate. Each Keshava stabilizes a dimension of life: wealth without greed, knowledge without pride, devotion without fear. Tribhuwan Keshav completes a decisive movement‚Äîrelease from the loop of return. The nearby Prayageshwar linga within the same premises echoes the synthesis of Ganga, Yamuna, and Sarasvati within Kashi, for Kashi is the city where distant confluences come inward. The confluence of merits, the confluence of vows, the confluence of destinies‚Äîall are drawn into one act of worship at a small shrine that upholds the weight of the three worlds by pure intention.

The story flows further back to the epochal sanctification of Kashi. When Lord Vishnu mapped His abodes in the city, He aligned them with Devi‚Äôs seats to sustain an eternal balance‚Äîpower and compassion, law and love. South of Trilokya Sundari, the Lord‚Äôs form as Tribhuwan Keshav takes on the task of severing rebirth, for the Mother‚Äôs unconditional shelter opens the heart to receive the Lord‚Äôs final gift. The injunction is precise: approach through purity, bathe in the Ganga, bow to the Mother, and then stand before Tribhuwan Keshav. The one who aligns action with ordinance touches the boundary where time loosens and the soul remembers its origin.

Stories of quiet fulfilment fill this lane. A householder in Kashi, burdened by grief, begins a simple vrata of Ekadashi; after bathing at Dashashwamedh, he offers tulsi at Tribhuwan Keshav for eleven consecutive fortnights. His heart lightens, his mind steadies, and an inner assurance rises: the fear of return fades. A widow arrives at sunrise in Karthik, lights a single lamp, and recites the Vishnu-stuti softly; the certainty that the Lord will carry her beyond sorrow becomes unshakable. A pilgrim completing the Vishnu Yatra ties the circuit here; the circle closes, and the fruit of merit ripens into clarity and peace. These are not mere anecdotes; they are the city‚Äôs living testimony to the Skanda Purana‚Äôs decree.

The sanctum‚Äôs intimacy is part of the teaching. Tribhuwan Keshav does not require grand ritual to grant the grandest fruit. Tulsi, a flower, a lamp, a mantra‚Äîthis is enough. The Kashi Khand reveals that in this city, the Lord‚Äôs presence compresses the road to liberation. The grilled door is not a barrier; it is a reminder of humility, a frame for the gaze, and a protection for the murti‚Äôs serenity amid the ghat-side bustle. The prasad is light, the footprint is small, the boon is vast.

In festival seasons, the current intensifies. Ekadashi draws Vaishnavas to this point with vrata, japa, and gentle fasting; Karthik month adorns the by-lanes with flickering lamps; on Gita Jayanti the teachings of dharma recollect themselves in the mind as tulsi touches the Lord‚Äôs feet. The presence of Shiva‚Äôs aspect as Prayageshwar within the precinct announces the harmony of the paths: devotion to Vishnu and reverence to Shiva culminate in one city, one vow, one liberation.

Thus the Sthala Purana of Tribhuwan Keshav stands clear: the Lord has installed Himself to the south of Trilokya Sundari Bandi Devi to end rebirth for the worshipper. The path is short and inward, the instruction is direct and compassionate, and the fruit is definitive. In the city where darshan is destiny, Tribhuwan Keshav is the milestone where the soul‚Äôs journey lifts beyond return.
