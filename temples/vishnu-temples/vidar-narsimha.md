## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

In the age when *adharma* swelled through the might of Hiranyakashipu, the Lord manifested as Narasimha to uphold the vow of protection given to His devotee Prahlada, tearing down tyranny and establishing fearless devotion as the straight path to grace in all *yugas*. In Kashi, this divine protection is localized as Vidar Narsimha at Prahlad Ghat, the riverfront gateway where the memory of Prahlada‚Äôs steadfast *bhakti* meets the living assurance of the Lord‚Äôs immediate help. The Lord‚Äôs presence here removes obstacles swiftly, aligning the heart with courage and the path with clarity.

Prahlada‚Äôs story is the core of this *kshetra*. Born in the house of a mighty Daitya king, Prahlada held only one treasure‚Äîunbroken remembrance of Vishnu‚Äôs Name. Hiranyakashipu‚Äôs edicts, threats, and punishments could not bend that remembrance. Teachers were instructed to turn the child‚Äôs mind, companions were taught to mock him, and the court was ordered to break his resolve. But the boy‚Äôs heart was set like a lamp in still air; his breath moved with ‚ÄúNarayana,‚Äù and his fear was none. In the end, the tyrant demanded to know where Vishnu was‚Äîwithin pillar or stone? Prahlada‚Äôs answer was simple and unblinking: He is everywhere.

The Lord rose from that very pillar as Narasimha‚Äîneither man nor beast, beyond the boundaries of boons, blazing and cool in the same instant. Twilight, doorstep, lap, and nail: the Lord measured justice with precision beyond mortal crafting. The chest of Hiranyakashipu, hard as a mountain, was torn like cloth by the Lord‚Äôs nails; the cosmos exhaled; *dharma* stood upright again. And Prahlada‚Äîunharmed, unwavering‚Äîwas gathered into the embrace of the very Lord whose Name had been his only defense.

In Kashi, Vidar Narsimha preserves that embrace in a daily, accessible form. ‚ÄúVidar‚Äù evokes the tearing that ends the reign of obstruction: tearing the veil of fear, tearing the net of hostile karma, tearing the inertia that blocks good beginnings. A simple darshan at Prahlad Ghat becomes a personal renewal of that moment‚Äîwhen a devotee‚Äôs small courage meets the Lord‚Äôs decisive mercy. The Ganga‚Äôs murmur below, the compact sanctum above, and the Name in the chest are the three strands of this *kshetra‚Äôs* living *vrata*.
