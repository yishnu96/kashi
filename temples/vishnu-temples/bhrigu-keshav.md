## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

Sage Bhrigu, the radiant son of Brahma and patriarch of the Bhargava lineage, once tested the supreme deities to establish the ultimate refuge of dharma across the three worlds. Reaching Vaikuntha, he awakened Lord Vishnu by striking his foot upon the Lord‚Äôs chest, and Vishnu, full of compassion, pressed the sage‚Äôs foot and removed the eye of egotism residing there, honoring the sage‚Äôs devotion instead of taking offense. This divine episode revealed Vishnu‚Äôs boundless grace and the transcendental patience with which He secures cosmic order.

In Kashi, the Lord abides in many Keshav forms to uplift devotees through distinct leelas, and among them He stands as Bhrigu Keshav on the Ganga steps at Gola Ghat. The Kashi Khanda tradition records the Lord‚Äôs assurance to Bindu Rishi that Bhargava Teerth holds His presence as Bhrigu Keshav, granting blessings when devotees bathe and worship with faith. Thus, the river‚Äôs edge at Gola Ghat becomes a living pilgrimage where the grace from the Bhrigu-Vishnu encounter flows to all seekers of protection, prosperity, and fulfillment.

Darshan at Bhrigu Keshav is direct and intimate, fitting the simplicity of Vishnu‚Äôs vigilant presence in this form, ever alert to guard the universe. The murti, described as four-armed and dark, holding chakra, gada, shankh, and lotus, reflects the Lord‚Äôs complete readiness to protect, sustain, and bless those who approach with humility like Bhrigu after enlightenment through the Lord‚Äôs compassion. Each simple offering at the ghat‚ÄîTulasi in the heart, mantra on the tongue, and reverence in the gaze‚Äîconnects devotees to the same forgiving strength that transformed the sage‚Äôs test into a lesson for all ages.

Bathing at the sacred site is praised in Kashi Khanda‚Äôs guidance: a dip combined with worship ensures the Lord‚Äôs manifold blessings, and while the historical Bhargava Teerth is noted as not physically extant, the merit of this worship endures at Gola Ghat‚Äôs enduring steps. Thus, the pilgrimage to Bhrigu Keshav becomes a vow to align with Vishnu‚Äôs patience and protection, drawing prosperity and inner steadiness in the very city where Keshav‚Äôs forms pervade every sacred quarter.
