* The current shrine functions within the Shitla Mandir campus near Prahladeshwar, aligning with the traditional Kashi Vishnu Yatra circuit.
* Renovations and upkeep have been community-driven, with local pujari-parampara sustaining daily worship and seasonal observances.

## The Sacred Story

_‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana_

In the eternal city of Kashi, where the Ganga flows as the mother of liberation and Mahadev grants kashi-vasa to seekers of all paths, Shri Narayana stands manifested in countless compassionate forms. Among these divine appearances is Narad Keshav, the grace of Vishnu bestowed upon the earth through the luminous life and tapas of Devarshi Narada. The story begins in the age when sages walked the worlds with veena and mantra, and wisdom moved from heart to heart like sacred fire.

Narada, the mind-born son of Brahma, is the messenger of the gods and the tireless herald of Hari‚Äôs name. His veena flows with the syllables of ‚ÄúNarayana,‚Äù and his travels encompass all three worlds. In his early life on earth, after serving great rishis who resided during the chaturmasya, Narada received the nectar of prasada and the stream of Hari-katha that awakened a blazing thirst for the Supreme. He entered the forest, sat beneath a solitary tree, fixed his mind upon the indweller Vishnu as the paramatma, and beheld the Lord once‚Äîjust once‚Äîlike lightning revealing the night. That vision became his life‚Äôs hidden music, his vow to speak only of Narayana, to carry the Lord‚Äôs name to every doorway, and to turn the world‚Äôs wandering hearts back to the ocean of grace.

When Narada‚Äôs footsteps reached Avimukta Kashi, the city not abandoned by Shiva even at the cosmic dissolution, he sought a boon that would tie his mission to the river of liberation. He prayed to Shri Vishnu and Shri Vishveshvara alike: ‚ÄúLet there be in Kashi a place where the seeker‚Äôs speech becomes truthful, mind becomes steady, intellect becomes luminous, and devotion flows like mother Ganga. Let those who bathe and worship there receive knowledge, bhakti, and fearless eloquence for the welfare of all.‚Äù In answer to this prayer, a sacred kunda, Narad Teerth, shone near the ghats, and Shri Vishnu established Himself there as Narad Keshav‚ÄîKeshava who blesses the vow of Narada and transforms seekers into torchbearers of dharma.

In the days when Prahlada, the steadfast devotee of Vishnu, sanctified the banks with his unwavering remembrance, Narada‚Äôs presence in Kashi grew deeper. Devarshi guided students, kings, householders, and ascetics to Narad Teerth, asking them to bathe, take a vrata of satya (truthfulness) and ahimsa (non-violence), and then offer tulsi to Narad Keshav. ‚ÄúSing,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúeven if the voice is small. Chant, even if the mind flickers. Where the Lord‚Äôs name is uttered, the world‚Äôs dust becomes light.‚Äù Under this vow, musicians found clarity in rhythm and raga, students found memory and discernment, scholars found humility before the infinite, and kirtan singers discovered that devotion turns words into wings.

Across eras, Narada‚Äôs interactions with devas and rishis shaped the narrative of bhakti. When pride arose anywhere, he carried the playful tests of Vishnu and Shiva to unveil true humility. When confusion arose about maya, he entered the Lord‚Äôs lila and emerged with deeper insight, returning again to Kashi to teach that wisdom and love are not two. Where Prahlad‚Äôs strength stood firm against tyranny, Narada‚Äôs gentle guidance showed that the Lord‚Äôs grace is the breath within courage. At Narad Keshav, both currents met: the iron of steadfast devotion and the fragrance of compassionate knowledge.

In the month of Kartik, lamps at the ghats mirror the stars, and Narad Keshav‚Äôs sanctum gathers seekers who recite Vishnu Sahasranama and Narad Bhakti Sutra with tulsi in hand. The instruction is simple and luminous: bathe in the Ganga, cleanse the senses, offer a lamp, offer a leaf, offer a name. A boy receives a notebook as daan, a musician pledges a year of daily kirtan, a scholar promises to teach without pride, a householder takes a vrata of simple, sattvic living. Here, the blessings of Narad Keshav are direct: vidya that does not inflate but illuminates; vak-siddhi that speaks truthfully and heals; bhakti that steadies the heart whether in joy or trial.

As time moved, the visible waters of Narad Teerth receded, yet the current of grace did not. The teerth became subtle, present in the Ganga‚Äôs flow and kept alive by the Lord‚Äôs name. The murti of Narad Keshav found home within the campus of Shitla Mandir near Prahladeshwar at Prahlad Ghat, so that the pilgrim could approach by lane or by river and keep the yatra unbroken. The path remains clear: remember Narayana, honor Mahadev, bow to Annapurna, receive darshan of Narad Keshav, and carry the name forward in life. The city is itself a scripture, and Narad Keshav is one of its verses: singable, learnable, and life-giving.

There is a gentle tradition among students and artists who come to this shrine. They bring tulsi, a small ghee deep, and a page of their study or composition. Placing it before the Lord, they pray for clarity without arrogance, for success without forgetfulness, for voice without vanity. Many recite the shloka that sanctifies speech with the name of the Infinite, and many return after examinations, concerts, or debates to offer gratitude. The sacred exchange continues as Narada intended: the Lord gives wisdom, the devotee gives service, and the world receives upliftment.

In Kashi, where every step is a mantra, Narad Keshav stands as the bridge between knowledge and devotion. The yatra that includes Bindu Madhav, Adi Keshav, Narad Keshav, and other Keshav forms of Vishnu is a pilgrimage of the mind and heart transitioning from information to illumination, from effort to grace. The fruit here is not only worldly success but an inner brightness that makes life serviceable to dharma.

Thus the Sthala Purana of Narad Keshav culminates in a simple discipline whispered through ages: bathe in sacred waters, keep the tongue true, keep the heart soft, chant Govinda, and let deeds be the commentary on the mantra. In this way, Narad Keshav of Kashi keeps Narada‚Äôs mission alive‚Äîturning the city‚Äôs lanes into pathways of song, and the devotee‚Äôs life into a veena that forever plays ‚ÄúNarayana.‚Äù
