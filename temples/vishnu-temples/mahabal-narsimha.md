## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

In Satya Yuga, Diti approached her husband Sage Kashyapa at an inauspicious hour, and from that union arose two mighty Daityas, Hiranyaksha and Hiranyakashipu. Hiranyaksha plunged Bhudevi into the cosmic ocean, and Bhagwan Vishnu took the Varaha avatara, the colossal divine boar, to rescue Earth and end the terror of Hiranyaksha in a battle that roared across the waters of creation. Grief and fury consumed Hiranyakashipu at his brother‚Äôs fall, and he undertook tapasya so austere that the heavens trembled, compelling Brahma to grant boons that shielded him from death by man, beast, or god; by day or night; indoors or outdoors; on earth or in the sky; and not by weapon or bare hand. Armed with this boon, he declared himself the lord of the universe, subjugating the Devas and demanding worship from all realms as he enforced his rule of fear.

During his absence on austerities, Indra seized Kayadhu, the pregnant queen, but Sage Narada intervened and granted her refuge in his ashram, where he spoke the path of devotion to Vishnu that the unborn child Prahlada absorbed even within the womb. Prahlada was born with a heart anchored in Vishnu-bhakti, chanting the Divine Name and refusing to accept his father as God. Infuriated, Hiranyakashipu unleashed punishments unthinkable‚Äîelephants, heights, and flames‚Äîbut the Lord‚Äôs grace shielded Prahlada each time, for divine protection is constant around ananya-bhakti. Holika, endowed with a boon against fire, carried Prahlada into the flames to end his life, but the boon failed against the devotee protected by the Lord, and Holika perished while Prahlada emerged unscathed, proclaiming Hari‚Äôs supremacy. He was cast into the sea, yet Varuna preserved him, and Prahlada‚Äôs heart only deepened in remembrance, calling upon the Lord who is ever-present in all that is seen and unseen.

When Prahlada returned to the court, Hiranyakashipu mocked his claim that Vishnu pervades every pillar, every stone, and every atom, and, in rage, he struck a pillar. In that instant at twilight, the Lord manifested as Narasimha‚Äîneither man nor beast, the fierce half-lion, half-man form‚Äîbursting forth from the pillar that itself bore witness to the Lord‚Äôs immanence in all forms. Narasimha seized Hiranyakashipu upon the threshold‚Äîneither indoors nor outdoors‚Äîplaced him upon His lap‚Äîneither earth nor sky‚Äîand with His claws‚Äîneither weapon nor bare hand‚Äîtore apart the tyrant at the very seam of day and night, thus upholding Brahma‚Äôs boon while executing perfect justice. The earth shook with the Lord‚Äôs wrath even after the adversary had fallen.

The Devas trembled before the blazing radiance of Narasimha, and they turned to Prahlada to approach the Lord whose heart is captured by pure devotion. Prahlada prostrated and sang in praise, and the Lord‚Äôs terrible form softened with compassion, for the bhakta‚Äôs voice is the sandal that cools the heat of divine justice. Narasimha blessed Prahlada, enthroning him in righteousness and assuring that even the touch of the Divine would redeem the lineage tainted by Hiranyakashipu‚Äôs deeds.

In Kashi, Mahabal Narsimha stands as the living echo of this Puranic truth‚Äîhere, the Lord‚Äôs fierce protection is sought and received, and the boon proclaimed in this kshetra assures that those who worship do not face the emissaries of death, for their path is lifted beyond fear. The lanes from Machhodari to the Kameshwar complex carry this story in every step, as pilgrims arrive for Mangala and Shayan darshan, seeking the strength to conquer inner darkness and the blessing of a fearless passage beyond. In this sacred corner near Trilochan and Prahlad Ghat, the vow of Narasimha‚Äîswift protection of the devoted‚Äîremains active, drawing hearts to surrender and stand firm in dharma.
