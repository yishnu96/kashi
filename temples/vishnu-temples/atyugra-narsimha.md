## The Sacred Story

*── From Sthala Purana*

Atyugra Narasimha manifests the intense, protective resolve of Vishnu, who took the man-lion form to defend the dharmic child Prahlada against the asura king Hiranyakashipu’s tyranny.

Hiranyakashipu’s boon from Brahma made him nearly invulnerable—no death by man or beast, indoors or outdoors, day or night, on earth or in the sky, and not by any weapon—which unleashed severe persecution of Vishnu’s devotees.

Prahlada proclaimed the all-pervading presence of Vishnu, and when challenged, Narasimha emerged from a pillar at twilight, seized Hiranyakashipu on a threshold, placed him on the lap, and tore him with claws—beyond man or animal, neither inside nor outside, neither day nor night, neither earth nor sky, and without a conventional weapon.

After the slaying, the gods requested Prahlada to pacify Narasimha, whereupon the fierce Ugra aspect softened into Soumya, reaffirming the avatar’s boundless compassion after the righteous destruction of evil.

In Kashi’s sacred geography, this ferocity is enshrined as Atyugra Narasimha—“Ati” and “Ugra” signifying excess and ferocity—assuring devotees that even compounded, terrifying sins are destroyed when worship is offered with faithful devotion near Kalasheshwar.

Within the Kashi Vishnu Yatra, darshan here aligns one’s journey with the decisive power of dharma, invoking Narasimha’s protection for spiritual courage, purity of conduct, and unwavering bhakti
