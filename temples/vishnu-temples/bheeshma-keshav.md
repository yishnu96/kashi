### The Sacred Story

*── From Sthala Purana*

In Kashi Khand, Lord Vishnu declares his eternal presence as Bheeshma Keshav to the west of Vriddha Kaleshwar, promising to remove fierce obstacles for those who worship with unwavering devotion, establishing this spot as a refuge for protection and grace.

This sacred name evokes the dharmic grandeur of Bhīṣma, the mighty son of Śāntanu and Gaṅgā, whose vows and valor stand sanctified by Keshava’s own presence and protection in the history of dharma.

On the battlefield of Kurukṣetra, Bhīṣma beheld Keshava as the Supreme Protector of righteousness, offering his celebrated prayers known as the Bhīṣma-stuti, where the Lord is praised as the infinite Supreme Person who guides and liberates the surrendered.

The same Keshava, honored by Bhīṣma’s devotion, manifests in Kashi as Bheeshma Keshav, so that devotees burdened by inner and outer afflictions can receive swift removal of dangerous impediments through sincere worship in the holy precincts of Mrityunjay Mahadev.

Thus, the tirtha-krama of Kashi embraces this Vishnu-sthana as a living current of protection: one darshan here affirms the direct promise of Kashi Khand that worship offered with faith dissolves troubles that appear as formidable as the trials faced by Bhīṣma on the field of dharma.
