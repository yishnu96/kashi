## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

In the timeless narration of the Skanda Purana‚Äôs Kashi Khanda, Mahadeva sanctifies Kashi as the city where every tirtha reveals itself for the steadfast seeker, and among these radiant fords is Prayag Tirtha established in the expanse north of Dasaswamedh Ghat. In this divine geography, the confluence-power that shines at Triveni manifests mystically within Kashi so that seekers attain complete merit without leaving the Lord‚Äôs own city. To guard that confluence-power and to grant unbroken punya to pilgrims, Shri Vishnu descended here as Prayag Madhav.

When the devas once feared that the world‚Äôs sins had thickened like darkness over the waters, Brahma performed a mahayajna and invoked the confluence-≈õakti into Kashi under the protective glance of Maheshwara. Responding to Brahma‚Äôs tapas, Shri Vishnu took residence in the Madhava form at this very kshetra, assuring that Ganga snana at Dasaswamedh, followed by Madhava‚Äôs darshan, would erase the stains of countless births. The river, the mantra, and the murti together became the triple boat across samsara: the current of Mother Ganga, the name of Narayana, and the presence of Madhava.

In the month of Magh, when celestial beings descend to bathe at daybreak, Prayag Madhav‚Äôs sanctum in Kashi receives the same luminous merit as the outward confluence. Pilgrims step into the chill waters at Dasaswamedh, offer arghya to the rising sun, remember the confluence of Ganga, Yamuna, and the hidden Sarasvati, and then walk into the lanes to bow before the Lord of auspicious fortune. Tulsi garlands circle His feet as a promise of moksha; yellow marigolds and sweet naivedya express the devotee‚Äôs longing for prosperity, grain, and the well-being of family.

The mahans of Kashi narrate how Maharishi Bharadwaja once guided tapasvins to complete their vows not only by Ganga snana but by sealing merit in Vishnu‚Äôs refuge. ‚ÄúSnana completes in darshan; darshan flowers in seva; seva matures in dana; dana culminates in inner peace,‚Äù they say. Thus, during Ekadashi, vrata-holders who keep the Lord in mind from dawn come for Madhav‚Äôs darshan and hear the soft murmur of Vishnu Sahasranama. In Kartik, lamps tremble like tiny suns before His smiling form, echoing the bright confluence within the heart.

There are elders who recount that the Lord here also bears the protective strength of Varaha‚Äîthe One who uplifted the Earth‚Äîreflecting the Dharma of safeguarding Kashi‚Äôs sacred ground and the subtle Prayag Tirtha within it. The lanes remember countless humble vows: a merchant who sought grain abundance and found his granary full after serving food to pilgrims; a mother who prayed for harmony at home and witnessed quarrels dissolve like mist in sunlight; a seeker burdened by regret who rose from the river, offered tulsi to Madhava, and felt the first breath of freedom from the past.

Every evening, as conches sound and the river mirrors lamps of the Ghat Aarti, devotees return for Sandhya Aarti of Madhav. The fragrance of tulsi mingles with camphor; the bell-beat stills the mind; and the final shayana melodies rest in the seeker‚Äôs chest like a vow kept by the Lord Himself. To step here is to experience Kashi‚Äôs gift: that each supreme tirtha shines inwardly for the one who surrenders. When feet dry after the river and hands fold before the murti, something quiet and eternal speaks‚ÄîNarayana has taken charge.

Thus the pilgrim‚Äôs path is simple and complete: bathe at Dasaswamedh, remember the hidden confluence, serve Vishnu as Madhava, share food and gifts with the needy, and carry home the protection of the Lord. In this way, the fruit of Prayag is attained in Kashi, and the embrace of liberation begins while still walking these ancient lanes.
