## History of the Mandir

* Gyan Keshav is placed at the Adi Keshav complex where Lord Vishnu first set foot in Kashi at the Ganga‚ÄìVaruna confluence, sanctifying the Padodaka Tirtha.
* Kashi Khanda references the Swet Deep Teerth near which Gyan Keshav grants ultimate knowledge; the teerth itself is no longer visible today.
* The Adi Keshav shrine is counted among Kashi‚Äôs most ancient Vishnu temples and houses the four-faced Sangameshwar Linga associated with Adi Keshav‚Äôs establishment.
* The temple suffered destruction in 1194 CE under Qutb-ud-din Aibak and was later restored under the Gwalior Scindia administration; after 1857 the British used the site as a military outpost.
* Present darshan timings run morning and evening, with access by road to Rajghat Fort and by boat to Adi Keshav Ghat.

## The Sacred Story

_‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana_

When Bhagavan Keshava entered Kashi as the Lord‚Äôs own emissary, His first touch was at the northern confluence where the Varuna embraces the Ganga, and that consecrating step formed the Padodaka Tirtha whose current flows into every vow taken at Adi Keshav Ghat. In the Kashi Khanda narrative, Divodasa ruled Kashi with exemplary dharma, yet the Lord‚Äôs cosmic sport unfolded such that Vishnu established Himself as Adi Keshav at this confluence to realign the city‚Äôs destiny with the eternal presence of the Supreme.

Here, on the bank where river-breeze carries the fragrance of Tulsi, Gyan Keshav shone near the Swet Deep Teerth, declaring that the one who bathes at the teerth and worships this form will not merely learn but awaken to knowledge that anchors life in truth and devotion. As centuries turned, the physical form of Swet Deep receded from sight, yet the tirtha-shakti remained accessible in the very Ganga at Adi Keshav Ghat, so pilgrims continued the rite of snan before stepping into the temple‚Äôs cool sanctum for darshan of Gyan Keshav.

The Lord of Vaikuntha stood as the giver of vidya, holding the conch of auspicious sound and the discus of discriminating knowledge that cuts delusion, while the mace steadied the devotee‚Äôs resolve and the lotus opened the heart to compassion-filled insight. Within the same sacred complex, Adi Keshav established the four-faced Sangameshwar Linga, binding Shaiva and Vaishnava worship in one flow, so that seekers know Kashi not as separation but as a single body of the Divine.

Sages like Narada frequented this northern threshold of the city, knowing that studies begun at Gyan Keshav ripen into wisdom when tempered by humility and service, and that a single round of Vishnu Sahasranama here clarifies the mind like sunlight on the river‚Äôs face. The students of shastras, artists of Kashi, and travelers on silent vows came to this mandir before examinations, initiations, and new undertakings, offering Tulsi and sweet fruits as naivedya, praying for steady focus, right memory, and pure intention.

In Kashi‚Äôs larger lila, Adi Keshav at Rajghat defines the city‚Äôs ‚Äúfeet,‚Äù where the Lord first anchored His presence; from here the pilgrim‚Äôs compass aligns‚Äînorthward to the Varuna‚Äôs embrace, southward to Dashashwamedha and Assi, inward to a heart tutored by Gyan Keshav‚Äôs grace. The pathways are simple and timeless: bathe at dawn, chant Govinda‚Äôs names, bow to Gyan Keshav, and let the mind pause where the confluence hums with unseen syllables that have guided muni and grihastha for ages.

Though invasions scarred structures and regimes repurposed precincts, the sanctity persisted; restorations brought the mandir back to life, and the Rajghat plateau again heard the conch at first light as lamps circled before the Lord who never abandoned His seat in Kashi. Today, the devotee walking up from Adi Keshav Ghat joins that uninterrupted stream, and the darshan of Gyan Keshav turns study into realization, effort into offering, and knowledge into devotion stamped with the city‚Äôs eternal blessing.
