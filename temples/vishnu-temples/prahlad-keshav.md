## The Sacred Story

_‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana_

Prahlad Ghat holds the city‚Äôs living memory of Prahlada‚Äôs unwavering devotion to Vishnu and the Lord‚Äôs fierce protection as Narasimha, commemorated annually through Narsingh Leela enacted on the riverfront steps. The presence of Prahlad Keshav inside Prahladeshwar Temple marks the spot where the line of Prahlada‚Äôs bhakti is honored, placing the devotee and the Lord in intimate proximity along the Ganga at this ancient ghat.

As the story is narrated in Kashi‚Äôs oral tradition at this ghat, Prahlada‚Äôs steadfast dharma draws the Lord‚Äôs immediate grace, and the city recognizes this grace through the focused worship of Vishnu as Prahlad Keshav within the temple‚Äôs river-facing wall shrine. The annual Narsingh Leela becomes the communal retelling that binds devotees to Prahlada‚Äôs path, turning the ghatside into a sacred theater where the protecting presence of the Lord is celebrated with song, dialogue, and darshan.

Around this sacred focus, the cluster of deities at Prahlad Ghat‚ÄîPrahladeshvara, Vidara Narasimha, and other sanctums‚Äîcreates a continuous circuit of remembrance, ensuring that every step near the water‚Äôs edge flows back to Prahlada‚Äôs faith and Vishnu‚Äôs answering protection. In this way, the sthala narrative at Prahlad Keshav remains an everyday experience: a compact darshan inside Prahladeshwar and a vast atmosphere of devotion on the steps of the Ganga, with the story renewed in collective memory each season.

For devotees, this is where the Lord‚Äôs blessings are sought in the precise manner preserved by Kashi‚Äôs custodians: the shrine on the right-side wall for quiet puja, the ghat for shared remembrance, and the wider teertha-tradition guiding purity before worship, all converging at Prahlad Ghat‚Äôs timeless riverfront.


## Conclusion

Conclude the visit by exploring Vidara Narasimha at the same ghat to complete the darshan thread that radiates from Prahlada‚Äôs devotion on the Ganga‚Äôs steps.
