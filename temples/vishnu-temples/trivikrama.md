## The Sacred Story

_‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana_

In the grand tradition of Kashi, every sacred spot has a narrative, a story that binds the city's spiritual geography to Puranic events. The Kashi Khand of the Skanda Purana details Lord Vishnu‚Äôs many manifestations in the city, each with a unique purpose. Among these is Trivikrama, the Lord who, in his Vamana incarnation, measured the entire cosmos in three steps. His presence in Kashi, to the north of Trilochan Mahadev, is a powerful reminder that the Lord of all universes is accessible in the sacred city, even in the smallest of shrines.

The story goes that when the gods sought a place on Earth where they could be easily reached, Vishnu declared that He would reside in Kashi, the city of His brother, Shiva. Here, He would take specific forms to grant boons to His devotees. As Trivikrama, He promised to grant not only material wealth (Lakshmi) but also the removal of all sins. This dual promise is central to the Kashi experience: the city provides for both worldly needs and the ultimate goal of liberation.

Pilgrims visit the Trivikrama shrine after first offering their respects at the Trilochan Mahadev temple, a practice that signifies the harmonious relationship between Shiva and Vishnu. The dual darshan ensures that devotees receive both the protection of Shiva and the grace of Vishnu. The sanctity of this location is further enhanced by its inclusion in the Panchakroshi Yatra, an ancient pilgrimage route that circles the city of Kashi.

The shrine‚Äôs compact size is a part of its teaching. It demonstrates that the all-encompassing power of the Lord of the three worlds can be contained within a small, intimate space, making His grace immediately available to every devotee. A simple offering of tulsi and a heartfelt prayer are all that is needed to receive the blessings of this mighty form. The devotees who come here often share stories of prayers answered, sins forgiven, and lives turned around by the grace of Trivikrama.

Thus, the Sthala Purana of Trivikrama is a living testimony to the power of faith in Kashi. The shrine stands as a beacon of hope, assuring pilgrims that even in the midst of a bustling city, the Lord of the three worlds is present, ready to grant both prosperity and liberation to those who seek His refuge with a sincere heart.
