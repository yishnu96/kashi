## History of the Mandir

  * **Scriptural anchor**: Kashi Khand enumerates Narasimha forms in Kashi, with Vitank Narsimha affirmed at the river-facing side of Kedar Ghat.
  * **Location continuity**: The murti stands just outside the eastern door of Kedareshwar Temple, on the left side of Kedar Ghat steps, sustaining open-access worship.
  * **Worship mode**: No formal schedule is required; devotees perform direct, simple pooja with tulsi, *deepa*, and *stuti* on the ghat.
  * **Sacred pairing**: The shrine forms a powerful Shiva‚ÄìVishnu confluence with Kedareshwar Mahadev, blending fearlessness and protection.
  * **Yatra context**: Commonly included in personal Vishnu circuits with Vidar Narsimha (Prahlad Ghat), Vaikunth Madhav (Scindia Ghat), and Trilochan precinct darshans.

## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

Kashi Khand sets Kashi as the field where the Lord‚Äôs presence is immediate and decisive. Lord Vishnu places His fierce compassion here as Narasimha so that protection is not a distant promise but a daily certainty accessible through simple acts of devotion. Vitank Narsimha at Kedar Ghat concentrates that promise at the very edge of the Ganga, where the water‚Äôs voice and the city‚Äôs breath become a single mantra of courage.

The divine narrative begins with Prahlada, whose life is the perennial teaching of Narasimha‚Äôs grace. The child of the Daitya king Hiranyakashipu, Prahlada holds fast to Vishnu‚Äôs Name with a stillness that no fear can touch. Edicts of the court, discipline of the teachers, and threats of punishment do not dislodge the remembrance in his heart. When the tyrant challenges the omnipresence of Vishnu‚Äî‚ÄúIs He in the pillar?‚Äù‚Äîthe answer is not debate but revelation. The Lord emerges in a form beyond the grammar of boons: half‚Äëman, half‚Äëlion; at twilight; on the threshold; on His lap; with nails that are neither weapon nor tool. Justice is measured in compassion‚Äôs exact time and place. The cosmos exhales; the promise to a devotee stands fulfilled.

In Kashi, the currents of that revelation are anchored to very specific stones, doors, and steps. Vitank Narsimha stands outside the river-facing door of Kedareshwar Temple, where the Ganga keeps vigil. The name carries the force of tearing through obstruction‚Äîtearing fear, tearing indecision, tearing the net of weak resolve. Here, a single tulsi leaf and a small lamp form a vow: ‚ÄúLet courage be steady, let the mind be clear, let the right decision take root.‚Äù The Lord answers in the manner of Narasimha‚Äîswiftly, exactly, and with the warmth of protection that remains after the danger has passed.

Kedar Ghat‚Äôs neighborhood has always been a living classroom for dharma. Kedareshwar Mahadev grounds the inner fearlessness that Shiva bestows; Vitank Narsimha shapes that fearlessness into protective action and decisive clarity. This pairing is by design, not accident. A devotee who bathes at Kedar Ghat, bows at Kedareshwar, and then lights a lamp before Vitank Narsimha is following the choreography laid out in the Puranas: insight, surrender, resolution. In this sequence, clarity does not arise as a thought alone; it appears as a blessing that the hand can feel when placing tulsi on the Lord‚Äôs feet.
