## The Sacred Story

_‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana_

In the eternal city of Kashi, where Vishnu and Shiva sanctify every step, Bhagavan manifested as Hayagriva, the pristine embodiment of knowledge who restored the Vedas to their rightful glory for the welfare of all worlds. When sacred knowledge was imperiled, Vishnu assumed the radiant horse-headed form and reclaimed the Vedas, establishing himself as the fountainhead of Vidya, mantra, and right understanding for gods, seers, and humankind alike. This divine current flows into Kashi‚Äôs Hayagriva Keshav, where the Lord stands accessible in a small but powerful seat, granting darshan that uplifts the mind and directs it toward Vishnu‚Äôs Param Padam as declared in Kashi Khand.

Here the city‚Äôs rhythm meets the Lord‚Äôs grace: pilgrims come from the lanes of Sonarpura and Shivala into Bhadaini, where Hayagriva Keshav gives a quiet, clear darshan that removes confusion and kindles true learning, exactly as the Hayagriva form promises everywhere in the Sanatana tradition. The act of bowing here is not a gesture alone; Kashi Khand states it confers tadvishnoh paramam padam, the supreme state in Vishnu‚Äôs presence, making this darshan a direct sadhana for liberation intertwined with knowledge that is steady and pure. As a living part of Kashi Vishnu Yatra, the shrine aligns the pilgrim‚Äôs steps with the wider Vaishnava circuit of the city, weaving Hayagriva‚Äôs gift of wisdom into the larger tapestry of Kashi‚Äôs sacred geography.

The Sthala Purana is simple and luminous: Vishnu‚Äôs Hayagriva recovers the Vedas and safeguards dharma, then abides in chosen kshetras so that seekers never lose access to the light of true knowledge that guides study, worship, and life itself. Kashi accepts this form in Hayagriva Keshav, situating it within the living map of the Vishnu Yatra while also retaining the echo of the older Hayagriva Teerth that no longer survives as a water body. The presence is concentrated yet generous: a small sanctum, open through the day, where one may perform archana, repeat Vishnu-nama, and internalize the Hayagriva current of insight that clarifies the scriptures and stabilizes the heart.

The nearby mention of Hayagreeva Yogini in Kashi Khand underscores that Kashi preserves both the seed and the shakti of this form, keeping the knowledge-stream vibrant within the city‚Äôs grid of shrines and lanes. In this way, the darshan here is not isolated; it resonates with the city‚Äôs Vaishnava circuit, where each keshava and narsimha murti completes the other and leads the seeker through devotion into understanding and through understanding into Vishnu‚Äôs grace. The boon of Hayagriva Keshav remains exactly as the Purana states: bow, worship, and advance toward the supreme station of Vishnu, sustained by the Lord who restored the Vedas for all beings.
