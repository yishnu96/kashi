## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

At the river‚Äôs edge in Kashi, Bhagavan Vishnu abides as Ganga Keshav, establishing this tirtha so that devotees may approach him where the Ganga‚Äôs sanctity meets Vaikuntha‚Äôs promise. The Kashi Khanda praises this very seat of Keshava, declaring that worship here uplifts the faithful to honour and glory in Vishnu-loka, the eternal abode of the Lord. Standing just above the steps of Lalita Ghat at D.1/67, the sanctum gathers seekers who ascend from the Ganga‚Äôs waters to offer flowers and Ganga-jal to Keshava with a heart fixed on liberation. The darshan at this tirtha is not merely local‚Äîit is a Vishnu-darshan stamped by scripture, where each prayer aligns the pilgrim‚Äôs path with the grace that leads to Vaikuntha. Thus, the ghats carry the footsteps of those who come by the lanes from Dasaswamedh to bow before Ganga Keshav, assured that their sincere worship draws the Lord‚Äôs honour and a place near him.
