## The Sacred Story

*── From Sthala Purana*

In Avimukta Kashi, Mahadev established the guardianship of Shri Ganapati in many forms, assigning to each a distinct power for the protection of pilgrims and the perfection of worldly duties done in *dharma*. Among these forms, *Pāśa-pāṇi* Vinayak stands as the compassionate Controller of the noose—an emblem not of fear, but of mastery over wandering senses, binding obstacles and leading seekers into auspicious pathways. When the devas sought unhindered passage for *yajñas* and vows in Kashi, Bhagavan Shankara entrusted Ganapati with the *pāśa* to seize impediments at their root and still the inner turbulence that breaks resolve.

In the days when traders, scholars, and pilgrims converged upon Kashi’s northern and western approaches, a market blossomed where needs of travel and livelihood met. There, as merchants committed to fair trade and clean conduct prayed for smooth transactions, Paas Pani Vinayak received their vows. The Lord’s *pāśa* gathered the threads of their scattered efforts, binding them into orderly success. Disputes mellowed, payments arrived on time, ledgers balanced, and the mind’s restlessness was tamed by Ganapati’s unseen grace. Students passing through the Cantonment roads carried books to examinations, whispering “Om Gam Ganapataye Namah,” and felt the tightening knot of fear fall away as Ganapati’s noose clasped their anxieties and cast them aside.

Once, a caravan-master confessed that every departure met with small but fatal delays—broken axles, missing porters, sudden messages that undid weeks of planning. He placed a simple vow before *Pāśa-pāṇi*: a tray of *durva*, a *modak*, and a clean ledger of fair wages. At the sanctum, the pujari set a ghee lamp and chanted the Atharvashirsha. As the sacred names flowed, the caravan-master felt the invisible tethers of confusion draw tight and then slacken, like knots opening one by one. The next morning, the caravan moved out without a hitch. Word spread: at Paas Pani Vinayak, delays dissolved, and departures turned precise.

In another season, a young aspirant preparing for examinations sought *buddhi* and *medhā*. Guided to recite the Ganesh Gayatri and offer 21 *durva*, the aspirant returned weekly on Chaturthi, each visit adding steadiness. The *pāśa’s* deeper grace became clear: not only did it bind obstacles outside, it gathered the flickering strands of attention within. Calm composure grew, and success followed as a natural outcome of inner order.

In family life too, those caught in quarrels and paperwork came to the shrine. Ganapati’s *pāśa* did not coerce; it embraced wayward motion and stilled it, like a mother holding an agitated child. Attachments that harmed were gently restrained; duties were set in right sequence; words found the correct moment; signatures appeared without struggle. The market’s bustle never drowned the shrine’s serenity; rather, the shrine trained the bustle to move in rhythm, turning chaos into cadence.

Thus Paas Pani Vinayak became the bazaar’s beating heart—small in footprint, vast in presence. The Lord’s mouse-banner hinted at agility, and the noose reminded that mastery begins with restraint. In Kashi, where countless vows are made, *Pāśa-pāṇi* ensures that vows do not fray but are tied to fulfillment. Merchants, travelers, students, and householders pass through Sadar Bazar, place a flower, a *modak*, a silent *sankalp*, and step back into the lanes with a new certainty. The *pāśa* has caught what hindered; the path is open; the work will complete.
