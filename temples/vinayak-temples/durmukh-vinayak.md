## History of the Mandir

  * **Scriptural frame**: Kashi Khanda establishes the 56 Vinayaks as Ganesh‚Äôs protective network across Avimukta Kshetra, supporting pilgrims after Shiva‚Äôs re-establishment in Kashi.
  * **Traditional seat**: earlier housed at CK 34/60 near Kashi Karvat, guarding a busy threshold between inner lanes and temple approaches.
  * **Relocation**: placed within the expanded Kashi Vishwanath Corridor to preserve darshan continuity, streamline access, and integrate with precinct crowd-flow.
  * **Living worship**: compact sanctum, self-puja friendly, harmonised with Vishwanath‚ÄìAvimukteshwar circuits; peak devotion on Chaturthi and festival days.
  * **Present role**: emphasis on pacifying malice, softening harsh speech/situations, and ensuring safe, obstacle-free passage to principal shrines.

## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

When Shri Vishwanath declared Kashi as Avimukta‚Äînever forsaken‚Äîhe set Ganesh at the city‚Äôs living thresholds so every sacred undertaking could begin and proceed without hindrance. In the tight, energetic lanes near Kashi Karvat, Shri Ganesh took the watchful form of Durmukh Vinayak, the guardian who neutralises the sting of malice and calms the rough edge of situations that gather around crowded passages. Here, devotion and daily life mix so closely that a minor misstep can ripple into obstruction; Durmukh stands precisely where such ripples begin and makes the surface smooth again.

In the narrative of Kashi‚Äôs restoration after King Divodasa‚Äôs era, the city is mapped as a scripture of movement: bathe, bow, begin; pause, pray, proceed. Durmukh Vinayak belongs to the ‚Äúbegin‚Äù and ‚Äúproceed‚Äù of that sentence. Devotees offer a handful of *durva*, a flower, and a simple sweet, and speak a clear *sankalpa*‚Äî‚ÄúLet my path be clean; let my speech be kind; let my vow be steady.‚Äù The blessing appears in practical ways: a queue moves without quarrel, a forgotten token is found before it matters, a closed door opens just as one arrives, a harsh exchange softens into courtesy.

The elders of these lanes tell of a time when the corridor was not yet open and the approach to shrines wound through a maze of shops, courtyards, and sudden turns. A young priest, anxious about reaching his *seva* on time through festival crowds, began each day with a pranam at Durmukh‚Äôs sanctum. He also vowed a small discipline‚Äîto greet the first impatient pilgrim he met with a calm smile and a short direction rather than a rebuke. The day changed quickly. People moved with less friction around him, and delays lost their ability to injure the schedule. The priest would say later: ‚ÄúThe Lord removed the *dur-mukha*‚Äîthe ill-face‚Äîfrom my own face first.‚Äù

Another story follows a shopkeeper whose counter stood near a bottleneck corner. Festival mornings could turn tense in seconds. He placed his ledger before Durmukh Vinayak at dawn during Chaturthi and promised three acts: keep the passage clear by keeping his bags inside, offer water to two elders at midday, and refuse to pass on harsh words heard in haste. The corner transformed across a season. Instead of being the spot where tempers rose, it became the spot where people paused to breathe, sip, and step aside for one another. The ledger improved too‚Äînot because miracles rained down, but because trust grew where sharpness had lived.
