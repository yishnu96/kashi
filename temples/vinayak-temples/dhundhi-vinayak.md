# Dhundhi Vinayak

Dhundhi Vinayak in Kashi is the foremost Ganesh shrine of the sacred Chappan Vinayak circuit, honored in Skanda Purana‚Äôs Kashi Khanda for restoring Shiva‚Äôs rule over Varanasi after the reign of King Divodasa; darshan here precedes Kashi Vishwanath for complete blessings.

  - Worship grants removal of obstacles, attainment of siddhis, and Shiva‚Äôs grace leading to moksha.

## History of the Mandir

  - The shrine is anchored in Skanda Purana, where Ganesha, as Dhundhi Vinayak, resolves the impasse of King Divodasa‚Äôs rule and restores Shiva‚Äôs residence.
  - It sits within Vishwanath Gali near Annapurna Devi, remaining a compact wayside sanctum consistently prioritized in the pilgrimage order.
  - The custom of first worshipping Dhundhi Vinayak before Vishwanath is a tradition preserved through guru‚Äìshishya transmission.

## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

In the age when Kashi shone as Avimukta, Shri Vishwanath and the city were inseparable, radiant with dharma. Over time, a subtle pride rose in both the Lord‚Äôs beloved city and its guardianship. Shri Ganesha, the remover of obstacles, chose to correct this pride and reestablish the cosmic order.

For sixty years, rains withheld their grace. King Divodasa, a ruler of righteousness, performed tapas for moksha. Brahma offered him the rulership of Kashi, but only if the devas, including Shiva, would withdraw. The condition was granted, and Divodasa ruled with flawless justice. Under his tapas-shakti, the city remained spotless, yet Shiva yearned to reunite with his eternal seat.

When Mahadev turned to Shri Ganesha with devotion, Ganesha manifested a brilliant Brahmin astrologer named Dhundhi, with the subtle power to confound absolutist certainties. With Dhundhi‚Äôs presence, Kashi‚Äôs inflexibility softened. The city‚Äôs perfection opened itself to the Lord‚Äôs embrace.

When the path was ready, Shri Vishwanath re-entered Kashi in a grand procession. Mahadev declared, ‚ÄúKashi has returned to me through the wisdom and compassion of Ganesha.‚Äù He conferred the name Dhundhi Vinayak upon Ganesha and established the sacred order: first worship Dhundhi Vinayak, then proceed to Shri Vishwanath.

From that return onwards, Kashi‚Äôs Chappan Vinayak are honored as Ganesha‚Äôs many forms, with Dhundhi Vinayak as the foremost portal to the city‚Äôs inner sanctity. Devotees begin their yatra at Manikarnika, purify their intention, and step into Vishwanath Gali where the compact shrine of Dhundhi Vinayak awaits. The pilgrim‚Äôs path opens with clarity, and the Lord of Varanasi welcomes the seeker into Avimukta‚Äôs living embrace.
