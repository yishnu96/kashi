## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

Kashi Khand proclaims the presence of Pranav Vinayak on the western bank of Maa Ganga, to the west of Raja Putra Vinayak, fixing the divine geography of Ganesh *tattva* with precision and grace as a living instruction for pilgrims seeking liberation and auspicious ascent to *svarga* through steadfast worship. The scripture affirms that regular worship of this Ganadhisha leads the devotee to heaven, elevating this darshan from a customary visit to an assured spiritual pathway granted by sacred decree within the city that is the body of Mahadeva himself.

The journey begins at the steps of Trilochan Ghat where the river widens in calm witness to countless *yagas*, mantras, and *pranams*, and the devotee proceeds toward Hiranya Garbheshwar, the golden-womb shrine, wherein Pranav Vinayak resides for darshan and *upasana* according to Kashi‚Äôs ageless temple rhythm and timings. The way is simple and clearly taught by elders of Kashi: approach by boat for effortless access to the steps, or by the road past Machhodari toward Birla Hospital, take the right turn and complete the *yatra* on foot, bringing the mind inward with each step toward the Lord who opens all beginnings and clears all obstacles.

Inside, darshan is close and intimate: Pranav Vinayak receives *pranam* with folded hands, soft *manasika japa*, and steady gaze, binding the pilgrim‚Äôs *sankalpa* to the scriptural promise that such worship, when performed regularly and with devotion, confers *svarga*, a fruit directly stated in the sacred verse and preserved in Kashi‚Äôs living tradition of the Vinayaks. The placement to the west of Raja Putra Vinayak is not merely directional; it teaches a sequence of reverence, inviting the pilgrim to honor both forms in one continuous movement along the river‚Äôs western bank, harmonizing the spatial and spiritual journey in a single, unbroken act of devotion.

Kashi Khand‚Äôs clarity leaves no ambiguity: the Lord here is ‚ÄúPranav,‚Äù and the boon is *svarga*, bestowed upon those who adopt the discipline of regular worship, making this shrine a beacon for seekers who wish to align personal effort with scriptural certainty rather than chance. In the cadence of temple life‚Äîmorning openings before sunrise hues settle, afternoon closures that preserve the sanctum‚Äôs rhythm, and evening re-opening when lamps kindle‚Äîthe devotee‚Äôs return again and again becomes the very definition of ‚Äúregular,‚Äù sealing the vow that the text demands and the heart fulfills.

Thus, this Sthala Purana is lived daily: approach from the river or the lane, mount the steps, enter Hiranya Garbheshwar, offer *pranam* to Pranav Vinayak, and let the recurrence of worship transform effort into attainment, exactly as declared by the *shloka* that anchors this *kshetra* in the eternal map of Kashi. The river bears witness, the ghat remembers, and the *mandir* shelters the vow, while Pranav Vinayak grants what the scripture has already promised, completing the circle of darshan, discipline, and divine result in the city where every shrine speaks with the authority of the Purana.
