## The Sacred Story

_‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana_

Kashi is the Avimukta *kshetra* where the gods establish visible guardians to uphold *dharma* and protect pilgrims, and the 56 Vinayaks arise from Shri Ganesh‚Äôs sacred mission in this very city as recorded in Kashi Khand. When Raja Divodasa held sway over Kashi by boon of Brahma, even the gods could not remain in the city, and the divine order sought a way to restore Shiva‚Äôs presence and the cosmic rhythm of Kashi‚Äôs sanctity. Shiva first sent *yoginis* and other devas to seek a flaw in the king‚Äôs otherwise righteous rule, but their efforts did not bear fruit within the bounds of the boon‚Äôs power. At this point Shiva commanded Shri Ganesh to leave Mandarachal and enter Kashi, for only the remover of obstacles could subtly weave a path that returned the gods to their rightful abode without violating the boons granted by the Creator. Ganesh entered Kashi and spread his *maya*, a divine governance of minds that gently guided citizens, ministers, and even the royal couple toward the re-establishment of the divine order without turmoil or injustice. Having completed the mission to harmonize the city with its eternal *dharma*, Ganesh consecrated himself across Kashi in fifty-six distinct forms, each form a living guardian and benefactor for devotees moving through the lanes, ghats, *kunds*, and temple courtyards of the sacred city. This network is the Chhappan Vinayak, a pilgrimage that devotees undertake over days, moving from shrine to shrine, stringing together blessings into a single garland of grace. Some of these Vinayaks are prominent standalone temples with full schedules of aarti and festive observances, while others are intimate sanctums within older temple premises where darshan is personal, direct, and quietly powerful. Koonitaksh Vinayak belongs to this intimate class: a guardian seated within the old Lakshmi Temple premises at Lakshmi Kund, close to Mahalakshmi Gauri, the goddess of auspicious abundance who, in Kashi‚Äôs sacred geography, complements Ganesh‚Äôs grace for new beginnings. The very placement of Koonitaksh within a Lakshmi shrine corridor underlines the Puranic unity of Shri and Ganapati, where prosperity is safeguarded by wisdom and obstacles are dissolved to ensure dharmic success in worldly and spiritual ventures. The Kashi Khand narrative states that the 56 Vinayaks act as watchful sentinels, and Koonitaksh is explicitly named among those who guard Kashi from the evil designs of wrongdoers, ensuring that malefic intent falters at the city‚Äôs threshold of sacred law. Pilgrims come to Koonitaksh to align their journey with this guardian force, seeking protection from unseen harms, clarity before major decisions, and the quiet courage to proceed on the path of *dharma*. Because the shrine permits self-performed *pooja* and is open across the day, the encounter is unmediated: a devotee arrives, stands before the *murti*, offers pranam, and makes a simple *sankalp* to remove obstacles and avert hostile influences that may impede rightful work or pilgrimage. In the broader pilgrimage, darshan at Koonitaksh becomes one more luminous bead on the *mala* of the Chhappan Vinayak Yatra, a practice that Kashi guides and religious groups complete over two to three days to absorb the many-sided grace of Ganesh in the city of Shiva. As the story cycles through the lanes‚Äîfrom Vishwanath‚Äôs precincts to *kund*-bordered shrines‚Äîeach Vinayak shares a facet of Ganesh‚Äôs mission, and Koonitaksh offers the steadfast gaze that notices deception, shields the sincere, and keeps Kashi‚Äôs spiritual economy clean of malice. In this way the *sthala purana* of Koonitaksh is inseparable from the grand narrative of Ganesh in Kashi Khand: Shiva‚Äôs call, Ganesh‚Äôs descent, the weaving of divine order, and the consecration of fifty-six guardians whose blessings meet pilgrims at every turn of the city‚Äôs ancient by-lanes.
