## The Sacred Story

_‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana_

In the divine order established by Bhagavan Mahadeva in Kashi, the Vinayakas are stationed across the city as guardians of every threshold, trade, learning, and journey, and among them stands Gaja Vinayak at Raja Darwaja as the fountain of majestic abundance and obstacle-removal. When Rudra consecrated Avimukta Kashi as the deathless city, He appointed Shri Ganapati as Vighneshwara, the foremost to be worshipped before any work, so that the merits of Kashi-katha, *yatra*, and daily *dharma* would unfold without hindrance.

In the cycles of time, a venerable line of traders, caravan leaders, and palanquin guilds flourished in Kashi‚Äôs Chowk and Raja Darwaja lanes. Their fortunes rode on elephants, ox-carts, and river craft, and each venture began with the *pranama* to Gaja Vinayak, the Lord whose very name holds the power of the elephant, the royal measure of wealth and steadfastness. The elders taught that Ganapati‚Äôs trunk turns toward compassion for all who offer 21 blades of *durva* and a *modak* with a clean heart, and that His blessing multiplies as *gaja-sampada*‚Äîvast, steady, and serviceable wealth that uplifts families and guilds alike.

In a renowned episode remembered by Kashi‚Äôs *mahajans*, a caravan-master named Gajasarman faced a grave trial. A consignment meant to fund a public *anna-dana* stalled as monsoon swelled the river, and an unruly tusker assigned to haul precious cloths panicked in the lanes near Raja Darwaja. In that pressing hour, Gajasarman stood before the Vinayaka and recited the Ganapati Atharvashirsha, offering *durva* and jaggery *modaks*, and submitted a *sankalpa* that the profit of the venture would be shared for the feeding of monks, pilgrims, and boatmen stranded by the flood.

At that moment, the tantrums of the tusker subsided; the animal fixed its gaze upon the sanctum and knelt. The river‚Äôs current calmed just enough at the ghats to allow the boats to cross with their cargo. The caravan returned not merely intact but with gains beyond accounting. Gajasarman placed the first share at Gaja Vinayak‚Äôs feet and established a *nitya-naivedya* at the shrine so that no day would pass in Raja Darwaja without Ganapati‚Äôs *modak* being prepared and shared. From this deed, Kashi‚Äôs elders framed a *vrata* at the shrine: to offer the first fruit of enterprise to Gaja Vinayak, to vow a portion for *dharma-karya*, and to commence any risky undertaking only after Atharvashirsha *japa* before the *murti*.

In another hallowed telling, Indra‚Äôs elephant Airavata once entered Kashi in invisibility as part of *deva-parikrama* and bowed at this very seat of Vinayaka. In honor of that act, Mahadeva pronounced that the abundance conferred here would carry the signature of the elephant‚Äîimmovable like *dharma*, powerful like royal strength, and resourceful like a guild well led. Thus, merchants invoked Gaja Vinayak before acquiring pack animals and before signing caravan bonds; scholars, too, took His name to gain *gajagami-dhi*‚Äîmajestic steadiness of intellect‚Äîso the mind would not stumble in debate, just as a seasoned elephant does not falter on rugged paths.

Kashi Khanda preserves that the Vinayakas raised around Avimukta act as sentinels of auspicious beginnings. The *vrata* here is simple and luminous: cleanse by Ganga-*snan*, recall the five-syllabled *pranava* of Ganapati, offer 21 *durvas* and a *modak*, and recite ‚ÄúTvameva Pratyaksham Tattvam Asi.‚Äù Householders pray for *gaja-sampada*, travelers for obstacle-free passage, brides and grooms for a stable household, and artists for unwavering skill in hand and voice. When Sankashti Chaturthi arrives, the *gallis* glow with lamps; the Atharvashirsha flows from one threshold to the next; and aarti rings under the watch of Bhara Bhooteshwar, uniting Shiva‚Äôs fierce guardianship with the compassion of the Elephant-faced Lord.

Elders advise that a Gaja Vinayak *sankalpa* is to be made with *dharma* in mind: promise a share for *annadanam*, education, or river service, and then seek prosperity. In return, Ganapati grants wealth that stays and serves, not a flicker of fortune that tumbles away. This is why the blessing here is spoken in Kashi as ‚Äú*dhan* so steady it could own and maintain an elephant‚Äù‚Äîa phrase that captures not ostentation but the reliable abundance that feeds families, protects craftsmen, and sustains pilgrim routes.

To this day, the *murti* within the Bhara Bhooteshwar precinct receives flowers plucked at dawn and *modaks* shaped in home kitchens. Travelers pause at Chowk, step through Raja Darwaja‚Äôs lanes, and make the simple offering before new journeys, new shops, new apprenticeships, and new studies. In doing so, they join the unbroken current of the Sthala Purana: Gaja Vinayak removes the stumbling stones, steadies the mind, and crowns honest effort with the majestic success that benefits many. Thus the vow stands in Kashi‚Äîbegin with Ganapati here, and let every endeavor ripen to welfare.
