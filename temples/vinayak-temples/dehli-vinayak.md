# Dehli Vinayak

Dehli Vinayak is the threshold-guardian form of Shri Ganesh on Kashi‚Äôs sacred Panchkroshi Yatra, enshrined at Bhatouli village on the western arc of the mandala; darshan here removes roadblocks, grants safe passage, and seals vows at the boundary of Avimukta Kshetra with fearless grace.

## Key Facts

  * **Part of Kashi‚Äôs Chappan Vinayak** (56 Ganesh shrines) and positioned on the Panchkroshi *Parikrama* as the threshold marker of the outer sacred ring.
  * **‚ÄúDehli‚Äù means threshold**; this shrine protects entry and exit points of the Kashi *mandala* and clears obstacles for *yatris* and householders.
  * **A Panchkroshi Yatra stop** (traditionally reached mid-circuit), sought for safe journeys, steadfast vows, and smooth transitions in life.
  * **Closely aligned with other outer-ring guardians** like Bhimchandi Vinayak and Uddand Vinayak in the protective circuit.

## Temple Essentials

#### Opening Times

  * Open practically throughout the day; mornings and late afternoons are ideal for calm self-puja.

#### Aarti Timings

  * No fixed public aarti is posted; simple aarti may be performed by the local pujari during peak yatra days.

#### Significance of Worship

  * Grants obstacle-removal at life‚Äôs thresholds‚Äînew journeys, house moves, business starts, exam phases‚Äîand assures safe passage on the Panchkroshi *Parikrama*.

#### Location

  * **Location Marker**: üìç [Google Maps location not available]
  * **Address**: Dehli Vinayak, Bhatouli Village, Panchkosi Marg, Varanasi District, Uttar Pradesh 221001.
  * **How to Reach**: By road from Varanasi city towards the Panchkosi Marg (outer ring); Bhatouli lies on the western sector, accessible by shared jeeps/temple vehicles during *parikrama* seasons. On foot-yatra, approach as part of the designated day‚Äôs halt, with local *sevaks* guiding to the shrine.
  * **Best Visiting Days**:
      * Panchkroshi *Parikrama* windows (especially Kartik).
      * Vinayaka Chaturthi and Sankashti Chaturthi.
      * Auspicious beginnings‚Äîhouse warming, shop opening, first travel day, and examination periods.

#### Visiting Details

  * **Contact Information**: Local pujari/sevak available on-site; arrangements for special puja are made directly at the temple.
  * **Important Advisory**: Rural approach roads can be narrow and busy in *yatra* season; facilities are basic, so carry water, light prasad, and a shawl in cooler months. Festival rush is high; maintain queue discipline, keep offerings minimal, and follow village safety instructions.
  * **Prerequisites & Etiquette**: For Panchkroshi walkers, respect village quiet hours, avoid litter, and keep to designated paths. Modest attire; avoid leather and plastic offerings; keep darshan brief to allow smooth flow. Seniors and children should pace stages conservatively; use local assistance where needed.

## History of the Mandir

  * **Enshrined on the Panchkroshi *Parikrama‚Äôs*** western arc at Bhatouli, marking the protective ‚Äúthreshold‚Äù of the Avimukta *mandala*.
  * **Counted among the Chappan Vinayak**, the citywide network of Ganesh shrines mapped in Kashi‚Äôs sacred geography.
  * **Village-led upkeep with periodic renovations** to support growing *yatra* flows; the sanctum retains a simple, accessible form for self-puja.
  * **Historically paired in practice** with neighboring outer-ring guardians like Bhimchandi Vinayak and Uddand Vinayak to secure safe circumambulation.
  * **Present worship emphasizes safe journeys**, clean starts, and obstacle-free transitions for pilgrims and local families.

## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

When Shri Shiva established Kashi as Avimukta‚Äîthe city never forsaken‚Äîhe ordained that the *mandala* would be held by guardians at its edges so that every entry and exit would be safe, timely, and auspicious. At Bhatouli, on the western threshold of the sacred circle, Shri Ganesh took his seat as Dehli Vinayak, the remover of obstacles who stands exactly where a pilgrim‚Äôs resolve meets the open road. In Kashi‚Äôs living scripture, a threshold is not just a boundary; it is a sacred hinge. At Dehli Vinayak, vows turn into journeys, journeys turn into merit, and merit returns as peace in the home.

The Panchkroshi *Parikrama* is the city‚Äôs great teaching walked upon the earth. Each day‚Äôs stage is a chapter, each halt a sentence of rest, each shrine a word that clarifies the pilgrim‚Äôs heart. When feet reach Bhatouli, dusk often draws near, and the body begins to ask questions that the mind had pushed aside‚Äî‚ÄúWhy am I walking? Will I finish? What if I fail?‚Äù Dehli Vinayak answers without argument: the work of beginning is already victory when it is offered at the threshold. A hand of *durva*, a small *modak*, and the mantra ‚ÄúOm Gam Ganapataye Namah‚Äù reset the hour. The night belongs to courage again.

The elders speak of the first circle when rishis mapped the guardians of the outer ring. They explained that thresholds come in many forms‚Äîleaving a house for the first time after a loss, opening a shop when debts still whisper, setting out for an examination, bringing a child across the crowded lanes, beginning a fast that will change a habit that has held too long. Dehli Vinayak presides over all these edges. The boon here is practical: obstacles will loosen, helpers will appear, and delays will lose their capacity to harm. The deeper boon is interior: the mind‚Äôs tremor at the edge will soften into poise.

A weaver‚Äôs caravan once halted at Bhatouli with loads bound for the city markets. The leader offered a simple *sankalpa*: to keep fair weights, to refuse dishonest bargains even when profit winked, and to help lift one stranger‚Äôs bundle each day of the journey. The next morning, the road answered‚Äîthe axle that had creaked for miles ran noiselessly, a storm turned its face away, and the buyers they met were the ones they had hoped for. Nothing miraculous, the leader said; only right timing. That is how Dehli Vinayak works‚Äîby aligning time, people, and path at the moment of crossing.

A young student tells another form of this blessing. She had failed to begin many times, circling the same chapter as if it were a whirlpool. Her mother took her to Bhatouli at the start of a family *parikrama*, and the girl placed a pen and a notebook near the lamp. The vow was concise: to study without noise, to teach a sibling for half an hour daily, and to accept honest sleep as part of discipline. By the time the circuit closed, the chapter that would not begin had already become three. At the threshold, she learned the first step is not small; it is the gate itself.
