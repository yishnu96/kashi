  * **Present worship emphasizes *sankalpa* for learning**, right speech, and honest commerce, with thanksgiving visits after achievements.

## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

When Shri Vishwanath restored his eternal seat in Avimukta Kashi, Shri Ganesh manifested across the city as guiding forms so every path of a devotee‚Äôs life would be supported‚Äîfrom household vows to pilgrim circuits, from trade to study. At the confluence of books and speech in Nai Sarak, he took the auspicious presence of Chatur Dant Vinayak, embodying the fourfold strength that sustains learning and clear action. The four tusks signify four Vedas as living wisdom, four measures of speech that must be purified‚Äîthought, word, writing, and deed‚Äîand four inner pillars every seeker must cultivate: steadiness, discernment, humility, and truthful effort.

In Kashi‚Äôs living arrangement, shrines are placed not only at riverfront ghats and ancient kunds but also within lanes where daily life is busy with buying and selling knowledge. Nai Sarak has long been such a lane, where students gather lists, teachers seek rare volumes, and printers and binders keep the city‚Äôs memory stitched together. In this rhythm, Chatur Dant Vinayak stands as the first reader and the last editor‚Äîremoving the obstacles that cloud understanding and ensuring that learning becomes character, not just accumulation.

An old account tells of a young pundit who would memorize quickly but falter when asked to explain. His teacher sent him to Chatur Dant Vinayak with a simple instruction: ‚ÄúOffer a leaf, a flower, and silence for as long as silence lasts.‚Äù The boy stood in the morning hush, the market yet to wake, and felt his hurry drain away. He returned to his studies with fewer words and more attention to each line; soon the explanation rose on its own. The teacher later said the shrine had taught him a method more than a mantra: slow down until clarity is audible.

Another lane-story speaks of a small publisher on the brink of closing shop after a season of misprints and delayed deliveries. He came to the shrine before opening, placed a *modak*, and promised three changes: to proofread himself daily without resentment, to compensate any reader who received a faulty copy, and to keep a shelf of low-cost primers for first-generation learners. The business did not suddenly grow large, but it stopped shrinking. The mistakes thinned out; trust in the lane grew; workers found their pride again. On Sankashti, he returned with gratitude, saying the Lord had changed his speech first‚Äîhe had learned to instruct without scolding.

Students preparing for examinations often discover that the mind fears two things equally: the unknown and the known that one did not respect. Children of Kashi come to the shrine with a pen, a small notebook, and a vow to complete revision with honesty, to sleep on time, and to avoid shortcuts that injure memory. Chatur Dant Vinayak accepts such vows with gentleness; the blessing arrives as fewer distractions, steadier recall, and the courage to attempt questions without panic. Teachers, too, come with their burdens: classes that will not settle, syllabi that overflow, voices that grow hoarse in the middle of a term. A quiet pranam before the *murti* has a way of restoring tone and temper so that instruction becomes a gift again.

The four-tusked presence also guides traders of knowledge. A bookseller who kept prices fair through lean years recounts placing his ledger before the shrine and promising to find a way to never say ‚Äúout of stock‚Äù to a child seeking a primer. The lane responded: neighbors pooled to keep a small reserve fund; a binder offered to repair schoolbooks free on Sundays; an elder donated old volumes for resale at loose-leaf prices. In Kashi, such cooperation is called *prasada*‚Äîblessing served through hands and feet.
