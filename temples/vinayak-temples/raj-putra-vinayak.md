## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

Kashi Khand narrates the presence of Raj Putra Vinayak on the southwest of Kharva Vinayak, establishing this Vinayak as the divine granter of restored sovereignty and rightful status.

The *shastra* states in clear words that when a devotee worships Raj Putra Vinayak, even a king who has lost his realm regains it, affirming Ganesh‚Äôs role here as the remover of obstacles to *rajya, rajya-bhƒÅra*, and *dharmic* leadership.

In Kashi‚Äôs sacred layout, this shrine rises near the ancient precincts of Raj Ghat Fort close to Adi Keshav, placing Raj Putra Vinayak within a powerful confluence where the city‚Äôs northern threshold meets the Lord‚Äôs eternal presence.

Devotees approach with steady focus, offering *pranam* through the grill door throughout the day and joining the morning and evening aartis, aligning their aspiration for rightful authority, promotion, or leadership with the exact promise of Kashi Khand.

The blessing is precise and practical: Raj Putra Vinayak removes the obstruction to status, restores lost position, and ushers in legitimate success, making this darshan a keystone for administrators, professionals, and seekers of high responsibility.
