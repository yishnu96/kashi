## History of the Mandir

  * **Counted among Kashi‚Äôs Chappan Vinayak**, a sacred network mapping Ganesh‚Äôs protective forms across the city‚Äôs inner lanes and *tirthas*.
  * **The shrine stands in Chitra Ghanta Gali** near Chowk, paired with Chitra Ghanta Devi as a local guardian arrangement for the old bazar quarter.
  * **A compact sanctum accessed through a grill gate** reflects Kashi‚Äôs wayside-altar tradition that supports continual self-puja by residents and pilgrims.
  * **Periodic community-led refurbishments** kept the *murti* accessible as market lanes evolved around Chowk and Thatheri Bazar.
  * **Present worship emphasizes *raksha* (protection)**, safe passage through dense lanes, and obstacle-clearing before larger darshans in the Vishweshwar‚ÄìAnnapurna corridor.

## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

Kashi Khanda records that when Shri Vishwanath seated himself eternally in Avimukta, Shri Ganesh manifested throughout the city as living guardians at doorways, ghats, gullies, and markets, so every sacred undertaking could begin rightly and proceed without hindrance. In the heartbeat of old Kashi around Chowk and Thatheri Bazar, he shines as Chitra Ghanta Vinayak, the vigilant remover of obstacles who stands beside Chitra Ghanta Devi to shield the lanes from hostile forces and disturbances. The very name speaks the teaching: *chitra*‚Äîclear sign and mark; *ghanta*‚Äîthe bell that alerts and awakens; Vinayak‚Äîthe one who sets order and removes hindrance. Where mind and city must stay alert, this form of Ganesh keeps watch.

In the earliest cycles of the city‚Äôs worship, merchants, scholars, and craftsmen filled these streets before sunrise. The clang of copper, the scent of sandal and oil, the soft syllables of mantras from house shrines‚Äîall mingled into a single breath. Yet the very density that makes Kashi intimate can make it vulnerable: a careless word, a sudden quarrel, a thief‚Äôs hand, a pilgrim lost in lanes, or a ritual blocked by confusion. For this reason, the Lord placed a guardian pair here‚ÄîChitra Ghanta Devi to ring the bell of righteous warning, and Ganesh as Chitra Ghanta Vinayak to clear the path the moment the bell is heard. Together they form a threshold: discernment first, action next; the Devi signals, Vinayak resolves.

An old telling from these lanes speaks of a goldsmith who once let pride sour his craft. Orders slipped, tempers rose, and a minor dispute threatened to become a feud. An elder guided both parties to Chitra Ghanta Vinayak at dawn. The elder offered a marigold and a *modak*, then said only this: ‚ÄúHear the bell.‚Äù In the stillness, the quarrel‚Äôs noise shrank. The men saw what the city sees every day‚Äîthat Kashi‚Äôs work is worship when done rightly. They shook hands without grand speeches, each promising one act of repair: the goldsmith to fix a damaged bangle free of charge, the buyer to stop slander at the corner shop. The issue dissolved by evening, and the workshop‚Äôs lamp burned with steadier flame.

Another account holds that when rishis mapped the Chappan Vinayak across the city, they set this shrine as a shield for pilgrims moving from Vishalakshi‚ÄìAnnapurna towards the Chowk web of temples. The instruction became part of local practice: before weaving deeper into the lanes, bow to Chitra Ghanta Vinayak, let the bell of attention ring within, and continue with clarity. Those who keep this order find the little protections that make a day flow: a helping hand at the right turn, a shopkeeper who points to the hidden staircase, a pause that avoids a stumble at a wet step. The city‚Äôs blessings arrive as timeliness and right encounters.

Household lore preserves a mother‚Äôs vow from these streets. Her child, easily startled by crowds, would clutch at her sari when the market grew loud. She came to the shrine on a Wednesday, placed *durva* and a small sweet, and promised a gentle practice‚Äîno scolding on market days, a short mantra together at the doorway, and a slow walk holding hands no matter who hurried behind them. Weeks later, the child began to hum while walking, and the tune held the feet steady through the press of people. The mother returned for thanksgiving, saying the Lord had given them a bell they could carry, not one that needed to be rung from a temple wall.
