## History of the Mandir

  * **Vikata Dwija Vinayak is one of the 56 Vinayaka shrines** of Kashi mentioned in traditional Kashi Khanda-based temple canons and local priestly itineraries.
  * **The shrine stands within Maa Dhoomavati Devi Temple** at Dhoopchandi, indicating a long-standing syncretic worship of Shakti and Ganapati in this neighborhood.
  * **Daily *seva* is maintained by local priests**; routine refurbishments and conservative repairs have preserved the sanctum through recent decades.
  * **The current darshan *mƒÅrga*** keeps the Ganesha *murti* accessible behind/adjacent to the Goddess, aligning with the tradition of seeking Shakti‚Äôs grace and Ganapati‚Äôs *anugraha* together.
  * **The temple‚Äôs public recognition** as a Vinayaka *Sthana* grew through 20th-century Kashi pilgrimage guides and oral traditions of the *Pandas* who curate Vinayak Yatra routes.

## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

In Kashi, MahƒÅdeva appointed the fifty-six Vinayakas to dwell across the sacred *kshetra* so that every seeker, at every turn, would find the remover of obstacles and the giver of *siddhi* and *buddhi* close at hand. Among these, Sri Vikata Dwija Vinayak resides at Dhoopchandi, within the powerful shade of Maa Dhoomavati, the Mahavidya who devours *tamas* and unveils naked Truth. Here, the path of *j√±ƒÅna* and the path of *shakti* fuse into one uncompromising current, and the *dvija* who bows at this shrine rises to *uttama pada* through wisdom tempered by austerity.

In the age when the streets of Kashi were perfumed with incense and the recitation of the Veda echoed from each *tola*, a young *brahmacharin* named ≈övetasharma arrived at Dhoopchandi with a single *tapasya* in his heart: to master *shabda* and *chandas*, to win the assembly at Mukti Mandapa, and to hold the highest seat in discourse under the gaze of Vishveshvara. Yet his tongue trembled in debate, and his memory shattered under the weight of grammarians who wielded Panini‚Äôs *sutras* like thunderbolts. Each time he rose to speak, bewilderment clouded his mind.

≈öiva, ever the guardian of Kashi, was seated within the *jyotirlinga* as Vishvanatha when Parvati, radiant even in her most ascetic Mahavidya aspect, manifested as Dhoomavati at Dhoopchandi to scorch the fog of inertia that clung to ≈övetasharma. In that same sanctum, Ganapati assumed the Vikata *rupa*‚Äîcompact, formidable, and supremely adept at striking the root of desire that distracts the intellect. Because ≈övetasharma had undergone *upanayana* and bore the *yajnopavita*, Ganapati revealed himself as Dwija Vinayak‚Äîthe patron of the twice-born‚Äôs vow, the master of *vak*, breath, and mantra.

≈övetasharma approached with humility. He offered *durva* and *modaka*, and with each blade and each sweet he surrendered the ego that craved victory more than truth. Vikata Dwija Vinayak stilled his breath, turned his senses inward, and taught him the silent pulse by which the Gayatri moves through the *nadis*. ‚ÄúMake the mind one-pointed,‚Äù the Lord instructed, ‚Äúand seat speech upon the heart. Desire dissolves in the fire of discernment. In my Vikata form, the knot of craving is severed; in my Dwija grace, the Vedic current flows without obstruction.‚Äù

For forty days ≈övetasharma observed *vrata*. Each morning he bathed in Gangaji at Manikarnika‚Äôs edge and came to Dhoopchandi through the living labyrinth of Kashi‚Äôs lanes. He first bowed to Maa Dhoomavati, offering only dry *naivedya* and holding back all superficial ornament, for the Mother demanded truth without embellishment. Then he turned to Vikata Dwija Vinayak, placed *durva* at the lotus feet, and recited the Atharvashirsha and the Ganesha Gayatri with unwavering attention. Around the sanctum he circled thrice, and then nine times, until the mind no longer spun but became the axis.

On the final night of his *vrata*, the city hushed, and the sky seemed to bend low over the ghats. In the sanctum, a subtle radiance unveiled Vikata‚Äôs presence as the true indwelling Self. The Lord laid his right hand upon the young *dvija‚Äôs* head, and rivers of meaning flowed‚Äî*akshara* by *akshara*, the universe arranged itself as grammar and prosody, as logic and revelation, as form and silence. ≈övetasharma‚Äôs memory became an unbroken garland; his speech, a polished jewel. The fear that stole words from his throat vanished like mist.

At dawn he entered the *pari·π£ad* at Mukti Mandapa. Questions volleyed across the assembly on *sandhi* and *samƒÅsa*, on Vedic accent, on the reconciliation of karma and *j√±ƒÅna* in the fires of *yaj√±a*. ≈övetasharma‚Äôs replies rose from the very seat of consciousness where Ganapati had planted his blessing. His words were measured like the syllables of the GƒÅyatrƒ´, and his meanings were luminous. No argument snagged; no counterproof pierced. The Panditas rose as one and offered him the *uttama ƒÅsana*, the highest seat, in the witness of Vishvanatha.

That evening, ≈övetasharma returned to Dhoopchandi, garland in hand, and prostrated where the form of Vikata Dwija Vinayak gleamed beside the fierce serenity of Maa Dhoomavati. The Mother granted him the steadiness to bear renown without falling back into vanity; Ganapati granted him the inexhaustible wellspring of discrimination. From then on, *dvija-s* who sought excellence in learning, students who trembled before examinations, and teachers who carried the burden of transmission came to this shrine. They laid *durva* upon the Vinayaka and offered truth to the Mother, and they left with minds clear, speech aligned, and destiny uplifted.

Thus Vikata Dwija Vinayak stands in Kashi as the intimate friend of the twice-born vow and as the secret ally of all learners. He breaks the spine of distraction, pares desire down to ash, and enthrones the devotee in the seat of wisdom. Beside Maa Dhoomavati, who reveals reality without adornment, he protects the *j√±ƒÅna-mƒÅrga* and grants *uttama pada*. The seeker who comes here with sincerity discovers that obstacles are only the shadows cast by a wavering flame‚Äîand that at this shrine, the flame is made steady.
