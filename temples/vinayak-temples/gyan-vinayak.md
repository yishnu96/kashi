## The Sacred Story

_‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana_

Kashi Khand describes Gyan Vinayak as a principal guardian of Kashi, established to keep the holy city free from hostile and *adharmic* influences while opening the doorway of true wisdom for seekers who come for darshan in the Gyanvapi‚ÄìVishwanath area.

As part of the Ashta Pradhan Vinayak Yatra, this shrine stands in the cluster of sacred lanes where countless pilgrims pass daily, and the Lord‚Äôs presence ensures that obstacles are removed and right understanding arises for those who bow before him with faith and restraint.

In this puranic vision of Kashi, each Vinayak has a decisive role, and Gyan Vinayak‚Äôs special grace is *jnana*‚Äîsteady knowledge that illuminates the mind and protects the field of pilgrimage, contributing to the city‚Äôs enduring sanctity across time.

The continuity of worship here‚Äîmorning and evening Aarti, simple darshan, and offerings in the intimate space of the old city‚Äîconnects present-day devotees with the puranic charge that empowers the Ashta Pradhan route and sustains Kashi‚Äôs spiritual defenses for all who enter the *tirtha*.
