## The Sacred Story

_‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana_

Kashi Khanda of the Skanda Purana records Tri Mukh Vinayak as the fear-dispelling Ganesh darshan of Sigra, establishing the three-faced manifestation‚Äîmonkey, lion, and elephant‚Äîas a direct revelation of Ganesh‚Äôs protective power in Avimukta Kshetra. The presence of the monkey aspect evokes the swift, alert guardianship that acts instantly to intercept dangers, standing for ready help to seekers entering the lanes of Tripurantakeshwar for darshan and *sankalpa* in daily life. The lion aspect holds sovereign courage, the regal force that dissolves dread at its root, making this Vinayak a living source of *abhayam* for travelers, residents, and *sadhakas* seeking stability before life‚Äôs trials in Kashi. The elephant aspect affirms Ganesh‚Äôs own *swarupa*, granting steady intellect and strength, so that obstacles are not merely removed outwardly but are transformed into inner clarity and resolve in the sacred geography of Sigra.

Devotees approach Tri Mukh Vinayak with a simple offering and a direct prayer, since this shrine is known for self-conducted worship across most hours, reflecting the intimate, accessible nature of Vinayak darshan in Varanasi. The same Kashi Khanda tradition that instructs seekers to begin any spiritual journey with Dhundhi Vinayak frames how pilgrims structure their Ganesh routes in the city, placing Tri Mukh Vinayak as a focused stop for the boon of fearlessness in the Tripurantakeshwar zone. In practical pilgrimage flow, devotees reach Tripurantakeshwar in Sigra and then take darshan of Tri Mukh Vinayak, receiving the blessing of courage before continuing deeper into the city‚Äôs sacred circuits and vows. The simple sanctum and neighborhood setting underline a Kashi truth: power is present without pomp where Vinayak stands, so that even an unannounced visit becomes a meeting with the remover of fear in the heart of Avimukta.

Across Kashi, Vinayak *upasana* is celebrated especially on Chaturthi *tithis*, and while grand festivities are seen at larger Ganesh *mandirs*, the essence in Sigra remains the same‚Äîdirect darshan to the three-faced Vinayak for inner boldness and outer protection. In this way the Tri Mukh form is not a symbolic idea but a living presence at a known address, where the triple visage and the strength of Ganesh converge to carry devotees past anxiety into assured steps through Kashi‚Äôs alleys and responsibilities. The directory notes even record the iconographic detail of three elephant trunks at this site, a reminder that the divine signs of protection are embedded in the very *murti* that accepts the day‚Äôs first whisper of prayer and the evening‚Äôs quiet gratitude.
