## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

When the sacred precinct of Durga Kund shone as a fountain of Shakti in Kashi‚Äôs southern *mandala*, Shri Ganesh established himself just behind the Kund as Durg Vinayak, so that every *sankalpa* made in the Mother‚Äôs presence would find a clear and obstacle-free path into action. In this arrangement, the grace of Durga fills the heart with strength while Durg Vinayak turns that strength into steady success, untying the knots of distress and aligning time, helpers, and steps.

Householders have long paired their vows between the Kund and the shrine: a mother seeking calm for a child in examinations offers a lamp at the water‚Äôs edge, then places a modest sweet before Durg Vinayak with the promise of daily study service to another child in the neighborhood. The blessing arrives practically‚Äîfear loosens first, clarity follows, and regular effort begins to bear a warm, unhurried fruit.

A trader on the cusp of opening a new ledger stands at the shrine at dawn, the city still quiet except for bells and birds, and pledges fair weights, truthful speech, and a monthly contribution of notebooks to a nearby school. Over the season, disputes soften, suppliers keep time, and customers greet with respect; the venture grows not by sudden windfall but by straight dealing and right timing, which is Durg Vinayak‚Äôs signature.

Students, carrying pens and slim notebooks, often begin a study cycle here with a small vow‚Äîfinish each day‚Äôs portion without haste, sleep at the right hour, and teach a sibling for thirty minutes. The mind learns to return when it wanders, recall steadies, and the panic at the edge of the question paper loses its hold, which is counted as a greater success than marks alone.

In festival tides, the two-entrance sanctum becomes a wellspring of ordered devotion, a living example of how sacred flow is arranged in Kashi‚Äôs narrow lanes. Families pass prasad hand to hand, aartis glow at their set times, and vows are sealed with small offerings that fit easily in a palm and even more easily in a life lived with care.

The gurus of Kashi explain that distress is often a noise that rises when conduct and intention fall out of step; at Durg Vinayak, the two are brought back together. Devotees speak their *sankalpa* plainly‚Äîfree of harm, tied to service, and paced with patience‚Äîand find that obstacles lose the habit of arriving in groups, delays fail to become damage, and the right person appears at the right corner.

There is a tale of a young artisan who, in a season of faltering orders, promised to repair one item free each week for those who could not pay, beginning the vow before asking for business to improve. The shrine answered by making his hands steadier and his temper kinder, and the lane answered by sending work that matched his integrity, which remains the oldest route to prosperity in Kashi.
