## The Sacred Story

_‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana_

Modak Priya is the endearing name of Shri Ganesha, the Lord who delights in the sweet *modak*, and whose blessings smoothen all undertakings when invoked with devotion and a pure offering of prasad from the heart. In Kashi‚Äôs Trilochan *kshetra*, Modak Priya Vinayak resides within the Aadi Mahadev Temple, granting all‚Äëround success to those who come at dawn, join the Mangala Aarti, and offer the *modak* that signifies fullness, wisdom, and the sweet fruit of *sadhana* under Ganapati‚Äôs grace. The morning sequence of Mangala, Shringar, and Aarti aligns the devotee with auspicious beginnings, with the temple‚Äôs open hours enabling seekers to return through the day for repeated darshan in the sanctified lanes above Trilochan Ghat.

Pilgrims traditionally approach this Vinayak shrine through the riverside rhythm of Kashi‚Äîan early boat ride to Trilochan Ghat followed by a humble ascent of steps, or a quiet journey by rickshaw to Prahlad Ghat Chauraha before entering the maze of inner lanes to reach the sanctum courtyard of Aadi Mahadev. At Modak Priya Vinayak, the simple act of offering a *modak* becomes a vow of right intention: obstacles are pacified, tasks find a rightful path, and the devotee steps forward with the protective assurance of Ganapati‚Äôs name resonating through Kashi‚Äôs ancient ghats and temple spires. In this living tradition, Modak Priya Vinayak is the immediate, approachable presence of Ganesha within the city of light, blessing householders and travelers alike with success in studies, trade, journeys, and spiritual resolve, as taught across the many Vinayak shrines that shape a devotee‚Äôs circuit.
