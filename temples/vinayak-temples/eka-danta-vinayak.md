## History of the Mandir

  * **Eka Danta Vinayak‚Äôs primary seat** is recorded at D-32/102, Pushpa Danteshwar, Bangali Tola, with the shrine described as a guardian of Anand Van.
  * **Additional Ekadanta darshans** are preserved at Sankatha Mandir‚Äôs south wall near Vairochaneshwar and within Adi Vishveshwar at Bansphatak, indicating a wider protective spread.
  * **The shrine aligns with Kashi‚Äôs Chappan Vinayak** mapping, where Ganesh forms are placed across lanes and *tirthas* to support every facet of *yatra* and livelihood.
  * **Integration with Ekadash/Ashta Vinayak routes** keeps Eka Danta actively visited by pilgrims and students in the Vishalakshi‚ÄìVishwanath belt.
  * **Present worship follows Kashi‚Äôs wayside-sanctum tradition**: continuous self-puja, simple offerings, and thanksgiving darshan upon vow-fulfillment in study or trade.

## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

When Shri Vishwanath seated himself eternally in Avimukta Kashi, Shri Ganesh manifested as many Vinayaks to guard the living city‚Äîdoorways, ghats, market gullies, and study lanes‚Äîso that each sacred undertaking could begin and complete without hindrance under Shiva‚Äôs compassionate gaze. At Pushpa Danteshwar in Bangali Tola, he abides as Eka Danta, the one-tusked Lord who protects Anand Van from hostile clutches and steadies the pilgrim‚Äôs resolve where devotion and daily work meet.

The guardianship of Eka Danta in Kashi is practical and tender‚Äîhe stands where speech is formed in the throat of the city, helping words remain kind, decisions remain clear, and footsteps remain sure in narrow lanes that carry centuries of worship. In scriptures and local listings, Ekadanta appears at three connected points‚ÄîPushpa Danteshwar, Sankatha‚Äôs south wall, and within Adi Vishveshwar‚Äîforming a triad of assurance so protection holds across inner-lane thresholds.

In the afterglow of Vishwanath‚Äôs re-establishment following King Divodasa‚Äôs righteous era, the city‚Äôs sacred map was arranged as a teaching: begin with Ganesh, receive the Mother‚Äôs nourishment, bow to Mahadev, and carry this rhythm into every act of livelihood and learning. Eka Danta at Pushpa Danteshwar became the place where students and traders learned to make vows that fit real life‚Äîhonest study hours, fair prices, gentle speech in crowds, and a promise to return in thanksgiving whether the result was grand or simply steady.

An early morning scene repeats through generations here: a student brings a pen and a small notebook, offers *durva* and a sweet, and speaks a simple *sankalpa*‚Äîcomplete the day‚Äôs portion without haste, teach a younger child for thirty minutes, and sleep on time. The blessing arrives as calm recall, fewer distractions, and courage at the moment the paper opens; the child returns later not only with marks, but with a steadier mind, which Kashi counts as the higher success.

Traders in Bangali Tola carry another covenant: keep goods an arm‚Äôs length inside, spare the walkway, refuse to pass rumors when sales are thin, and greet impatience with courteous brevity. Over seasons, such vows change the very air‚Äîcorners where tempers rose become corners where people pause to make space; delays fail to organize into damage; and neighboring shops learn to be each other‚Äôs solutions.

The one-tusk teaching is itself a Kashi lesson‚Äîretain what is essential and offer the rest to *dharma*, the way Ganesh offered a tusk to write destiny into wisdom. At Sankatha‚Äôs south wall, Eka Danta continues this work‚Äîguarding households at the riverward edge where rites ask for composure, while at Bansphatak within Adi Vishveshwar he turns the devotee from intention to action without friction.
