## History of the Mandir

  * **The shrine is one of the enumerated Vinayak *sthalas*** in Kashi Khanda, integrated into Kashi‚Äôs sacred Ganesh circuit in the Purana‚Äôs prescriptive *yatra* tradition.
  * **The *murti* of Nagesh Vinayak resides within the Nageshwar Temple premises** at Patani Tola, tying Ganesh worship to Shiva‚Äôs *jyotirlinga-tattva* in Kashi‚Äôs core.
  * **The locality around Bhosale Ghat bears Maratha-Bhonsale patronage marks**; the precinct likely saw refurbishments during the 18th‚Äì19th centuries, with periodic repairs in the modern era.
  * **Regular aarti and *archana*** follow Kashi‚Äôs Ganesh *paddhati*, with special observances on Chaturthi *vratas* becoming standard in the late medieval to early modern period.

## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

In the timeless city of Kashi, where Shiva‚Äôs presence vibrates in every lane, the guardianship of the city‚Äôs thresholds and pilgrim vows rests with Ganapati, whose 56 Vinayak forms encircle and suffuse the *kshetra* with auspiciousness. Among these forms, Nagesh Vinayak holds a distinct place, aligned with the mysteries and grace of the Naga realms and the subtle serpentine energies that course beneath the ghats and temples like hidden rivers of power.

When the devas sought passage to Kashi for a great *sabha* at Manikarnika, a fierce obstruction arose in the southern quarter near the dwelling of Uddandamund Ganapati, the form of Ganesha who had once severed the heads of arrogant *asuras* and thus bears the memory of felled pride. In that time, Takshaka of the Nagas, carrying the burden of ancestral resentments from conflicts with kings and sages, desired reconciliation and sanctuary within Shiva‚Äôs city. Yet the bond of the Nagas to the subterranean currents made their presence heavy and unquiet for pilgrims unprepared for their potent gaze.

Shiva, the Lord of Kashi, called upon Ganapati to stabilize the pathways, to make the pilgrim‚Äôs steps graceful and unafraid, and to grant the Nagas a seat of honor without unsettling the sanctity of human vows. Ganapati manifested as Nagesh Vinayak, situating this form to the south of Uddandamund Ganapati, harmonizing the fierce memory of severed pride with the cool, coiling wisdom of the serpent clans. Vasuki himself approached, encircled the feet of Nagesh Vinayak in reverence, and offered a gem from the Naga treasury, a symbol of clear, unwavering discernment.

In the presence of Shiva and the sages who were then assembled for vows by the Ganga, Nagesh Vinayak promised this boon: those who arrive at Kashi and bow before this *murti* would be immune from the sting of hidden malice, from the bite of envy that slithers in the heart, and from the karmic entanglements symbolized by the serpent‚Äôs coil. Naga blessings would flow to such worshippers, granting stability to households, clarity to students, and protection to travelers who cross rivers and forests where serpentine life thrives. Moreover, souls who complete darshan with devotion would be received in Nagaloka not as strangers but as honored guests, welcomed to the secret halls of serpent wisdom at life‚Äôs end.

On a Sankashti Chaturthi that followed, a merchant caravan paused at Bhosale Ghat, the river wide and luminous under the moon. Among them was a young trader whose family had long feared *sarpa dosha*, the inexplicable entanglements and sudden reversals that restricted prosperity. Guided by a local priest, the caravan made its way through the Patani Tola lanes to Nagesh Vinayak in the Nageshwar precincts. The young trader offered *durva* grass and *modak*, recited the Ganapati Atharvashirsha once, and the 108 names of Ganesh with single-minded attention. As the Sandhya Aarti rose, a quiet assurance settled over his heart, like the coolness of the river mist on the ghat steps.

Months later, as the caravan returned, the trader‚Äôs ledgers told a different story‚Äîsteady trade, faithful partners, and smooth passages through regions where serpents were both feared and revered. He returned to Kashi, this time on Vinayaka Chaturthi, to place a silver serpent anklet before Nagesh Vinayak, affirming a vow: whenever fortune smiled or difficulties dissolved, gratitude would be given first at this shrine, where Ganapati and the Nagas share a pact under Shiva‚Äôs watch.

In another age, a young student came seeking clarity for studies, frightened of examinations and the hidden pitfalls of distraction. Directed to Nagesh Vinayak, the student performed *pradakshina*, each circumambulation accompanied by a mantra bead, each bead a step of courage. The weight of anxiety loosened, like a serpent shedding old skin, and the mind found a new steadiness. In course of time, the studies blossomed; the student returned at Nag Panchami with a garland made of fresh *durva*, offering thanks before proceeding to visit Uddandamund Ganapati, honoring the southern guardianship that keeps the city‚Äôs pilgrim roads open and auspicious.
