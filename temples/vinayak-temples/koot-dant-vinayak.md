## History of the Mandir

  * **The shrine is housed within the precincts of Kina Ram Ashram** at Krim Kund, a historic spiritual campus of the Kinaram tradition in the Shivala area.
  * **The Koot Dant Vinayak worship here is aligned** with the Kashi Vinayak Yatra, in which distinct forms of Ganesh protect the city‚Äôs directions and purify pilgrim routes.
  * **The present darshan arrangement is maintained by the ashram authorities**; devotees perform simple self-led *pooja*, reflecting the straightforward Ganesh *upasana*.
  * **The current timings follow the ashram‚Äôs daily schedule**; the exact date of this specific sanctum‚Äôs installation is not publicly documented, but regular worship has been ongoing in modern times with steady local devotion.

## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

In Kashi, Bhagavan Ganesh stands as Ekadanta, the One-Tusked, whose broken tusk is the eternal sign of unshakeable resolve and true wisdom. The name Koot Dant‚Äî‚Äúthe decisive, broken tusk‚Äù‚Äîspeaks directly to the moment where sacrifice transforms into knowledge, and force turns into compassion. In this *tirtha*, the divine presence of Koot Dant Vinayak guards the lanes of Shivala and the life-giving waters around Krim Kund, ensuring that the pilgrim who bows here finds a path through even the hardest karmic knots.

When Maharishi Vedavyasa resolved to give the world the Mahabharata‚Äîits *dharma*, its complex duties, and its living wisdom‚Äîhe sought a scribe who could keep pace with the relentless flow of truth. Bhagavan Ganesh came forward, insisting that the dictation must be unbroken, and that the scribe must understand each verse as it was given. Vedavyasa agreed, composing *shlokas* of layered meaning. As the grand composition advanced and the stylus wore down, Ganesh broke His own tusk and continued writing, showing the world that *vidya* is worth any sacrifice, and that the right vow, once taken, must be fulfilled without pause. The tusk became the pen, the pen became the bridge, and the bridge became the scripture that even now guides kings and seekers in their tests and triumphs.

In another sacred moment linked to the guardianship of Kashi‚Äôs thresholds, Parashurama, the fierce *avatara* of Vishnu, arrived to see Mahadeva. Ganesh, the gatekeeper of the Lord, stood firm at the door as duty demanded. Words rose to heat, and Parashurama hurled the axe gifted by Shiva Himself. Ganesh, knowing the sanctity of His Father‚Äôs weapon, received it upon His tusk rather than dishonor the boon given to the warrior-sage. The tusk broke, but a higher law stood intact‚Äîrespect for the divine order, and compassion that meets fury with understanding. The One-Tusked smiled, turning pain into the teaching: true strength is not in wounding, but in bearing, transforming, and protecting the *dharma* that sustains all.

On Bhadrapada Shukla Chaturthi, when the moon‚Äôs pride rose over the city and laughter turned to mockery, Ganesh cast His tusk and pronounced the well-known *vrata* to correct arrogance and to protect devotees from false blame. From that day, Sankashti Chaturthi became a pillar of monthly worship, a *vrata* that Kashi observes with special love. Here in Shivala, the *vrata* breathes in the simple flame of the *deepam* before Koot Dant Vinayak‚Äî*modaks* are offered, *durva* is placed with folded hands, and the mind stands steady like the still surface of Krim Kund before dawn.

Kashi‚Äôs Vinayaks are the city‚Äôs sentinels. Each guards a direction, a crossing, a story, and a vow. Koot Dant Vinayak‚Äîplaced within the pathways of the southern quarter‚Äîcarries the mark of doing what must be done to deliver higher good, even at a personal cost. The broken tusk is not a loss; it is the seal of completion. It says: begin with purity, continue without doubt, and end only when the work is truly finished. For students, it becomes the courage to face examinations and long studies; for householders, the patience to resolve family and legal hurdles; for travelers and pilgrims, the clearing away of blockages that appear at the last step; for seekers, the opening through which understanding dawns.
