## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

In the Kashi Khanda, the sacred city is safeguarded by a *mandala* of fifty-six Vinayakas established by Ganapati to uphold *dharma* and protect the Vishwanath *kshetra* across seven concentric circles of eight deities each, centering on Dhundhiraja near Shri Vishwanath.

When the divine plan restored Shiva‚Äôs presence to Avimukta Kashi, Ganapati manifested in fifty-six forms to anchor protection in every direction, weaving a living shield so that every pilgrim and resident moving through the lanes would be sheltered by a specific Vinayak‚Äôs power.

Within this celestial geometry, Kali Priya Vinayak takes a distinctive place in the fifth circle, at the southern corner of the cosmic grid, yet textually signposted in relation to Sinhatund Vinayak as the one who stands to the north of Sinhatund, indicating proximity and guardianship continuity in the Vishwanath zone.

The name ‚ÄúKali Priya‚Äù in this context does not favor mundane discord but signifies divine strategy: this Vinayak confounds the proud and sows division among those who hate the *tirtha* and obstruct pilgrims, thereby protecting the sanctity of Kashi‚Äôs pathways and the freedom of sacred movement for seekers.

As pilgrims step from Dashashwamedh towards Vishwanath Gali, the presence of Kali Priya Vinayak behind Sakshi Vinayak within Manaprakameshwar manifests this exact protection‚Äîadversaries of *dharma* lose cohesion, while the devotee‚Äôs *sankalpa* for peace and safe darshan gains strength.

The Kashi Khanda‚Äôs line on Kali Priya is precise: ‚ÄúHe always causes problems among those who hate the pilgrims,‚Äù meaning their schemes unravel at the threshold of Kashi‚Äôs sanctity, a reversal driven by the deity‚Äôs will to defend *tirtha*, *satsanga*, and the unbroken flow of darshan in Vishwanath‚Äôs corridors.

This power is paired with another grace recorded for Kali Priya: the softening of pride and quarrels within the seeker‚Äôs life, because true protection includes harmonizing inner tendencies that create conflict, allowing a devotee to walk Kashi‚Äôs *mandala* with humility and steadiness.

The geometry of the 56 is more than mapping; it is a living *sadhana* route, and in the fifth circle where Kali Priya stands, the pilgrim‚Äôs obstacles change texture‚Äîfrom outward opposition to subtler egoic friction‚Äîwhich this Vinayak addresses through the vine of *bhakti*, mantra, and simple offerings like *durva* and *modak*.

In proximity to Sinhatund Vinayak, whose leonine aspect signals fearless protection, Kali Priya‚Äôs function completes the safeguard: where courage is needed, strife among the unrighteous disperses; where quiet passage is needed, the devotee‚Äôs path clears as malefactors turn upon their own discord.

Thus, the darshan here is intentionally unadorned and accessible‚Äîopen hours, self-pooja, and a brief, potent recitation of the Kashi Khanda *shloka*‚Äîbecause the deity‚Äôs action is swift, and the *galli* itself becomes the sanctum where the pilgrim‚Äôs *sankalpa* is received and shielded.
