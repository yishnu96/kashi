## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

In the age when Mahadev declared Kashi as Avimukta Kshetra, he established the guardianship of Vinayakas throughout the city so that every devotee‚Äôs path would be free from hindrances and every *vrata* would fructify in full. Among these forms stands Gaja Karna Vinayak, whose name reveals the wisdom of sacred listening‚Äîears like the elephant, wide to the Veda and sensitive to *dharma‚Äôs* faintest whisper.

When Bhagwan Rudra granted *moksha* to Gajasura and adorned the hide in Kashi, Devi Parvati sanctified the city‚Äôs inner *gallis* with auspicious shrines of Ganapati so that all acts of worship would begin in the right sound‚ÄîOm Gam Ganapataye. In the lanes near Ishaneshwar, she consecrated the form known as Gaja Karna, and declared that those who present *durva*, *modak*, and pure-hearted *japa* here will have the right counsel arrive at the right time, and prosperity will walk with clarity, not confusion.

In another moment of Kashi‚Äôs living chronicle, a Varanasi *vanik* named Dharmapala struggled to move his bales across the crowded *chowk*; documents stalled, assistants fell ill, and accounts lost their balance. On Sankashti night, he heard the Atharvashirsha in the flower market‚Äôs fragrance; guided inward, he reached the Vinayak court near Ishaneshwar. Placing a simple coconut and 21 *durva* blades, he circled thrice and recited the names‚ÄîSumukha, Ekadanta, Kapila, Gaja Karna. The obstruction that held his ledger loosed its grip; by the week‚Äôs end, creditors turned into partners, and the family vow of *annadan* in Bhadrapada became a yearly *vrata*.

Rishis who taught in Kashi‚Äôs *pathshalas* brought their students to Gaja Karna before *vyakarana* classes, explaining that learning begins with listening, and listening is sanctified when offered to Ganapati. They taught the children to cup the ear with one palm during mantra *japa*, signalling that knowledge sits not in the rush to speak, but in the discipline to hear. Those who sought relief from uncertainties in speech, stammer, and interview fears performed a 108-name archana here and found their words growing steady, like the Ganga‚Äôs middle current that neither floods nor dries.

The Devas themselves honored this *kshetra*. When the writing of the Bharata was to commence, Sage Vyasa meditated upon Vinayaka so the river of words would flow without dam or ditch. In that silent dawn, the presence of Gaja Karna blessed the scribe‚Äôs vow to write only what was perfectly received, for the elephant-eared lord admitted nothing impure into the stream of meaning. Thus, in Kashi‚Äôs sanctity where every sound is surrounded by divinity, Gaja Karna guards the threshold between hearing and understanding.

Mothers in the neighborhood do simple, shining worship. They bring fresh turmeric, a pinch of camphor, and a small bowl of jaggery rice. Prayers are made for children to listen to elders with respect, to teachers with attention, and to conscience with devotion. Householders starting a new shop, a renovation, or the first day of employment offer a sugarcane piece and whisper their project‚Äôs name near the pedestal, sealing their *sankalpa* with Atharvashirsha.
