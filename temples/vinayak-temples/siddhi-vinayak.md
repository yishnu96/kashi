## The Sacred Story

_── From Sthala Purana_

In Prabhadevi, the grace of Siddhi Vinayak shone through the living bond between Shree Swami Samarth of Akkalkot and Shree Ramkrishna Jambhekar Maharaj, a devoted seeker whose heart remained anchored to the Ganesha of this *mandir*. During a night of intimate *satsang* under the banyan tree in Akkalkot, Swami Samarth asked what boon should be given, and Jambhekar Maharaj asked not for himself but for the glory of Shree Siddhivinayak in Mumbai so that unending streams of devotees would receive blessings forever.

Swami Samarth, delighted with the selfless prayer, placed divine arms upon the devotee and declared the boon, directing him to plant a Mandar (*parijat*) sapling at the Prabhadevi temple after returning to Mumbai, a living symbol of the shrine’s destined rise in radiance. The Master pronounced that as the Mandar would grow inch by inch, Siddhivinayak’s renown would grow the same way, reaching full bloom when the Mandar itself flourished into fullness as a sign of fulfilled blessing.

Obedient to the Guru’s instruction, Jambhekar Maharaj returned to Prabhadevi and planted the Mandar on the following Tuesday within the temple, offering folded‑hand prayers that the Guru’s word manifest through the Siddhi Vinayak he loved. He stood before the *murti*, invoking Ganaraya that the boon be made true, that the blaze of that glory draw thousands into darshan, and that every sincere wish be fulfilled in this sanctum for generations.

From that devotion, the temple’s destiny unfolded: Tuesdays became vibrant rivers of faith, and special Chaturthi days surged with lakhs of pilgrims who came for darshan, aarti, and *sankalp* to the wish‑fulfilling Lord seated resplendent in the sanctum with Ashtavinayak iconography guarding the threshold. The temple architecture grew into a multi‑storeyed complex with a gold‑coated dome, expanded *seva* facilities, and a living rhythm of *naivedya*, *prasada*, and continuous worship, mirroring the Mandar’s promised ascent into full bloom.

Thus, the Sthala Purana of Prabhadevi’s Siddhi Vinayak is the story of a selfless prayer, a Guru’s boon, a sacred sapling, and a city’s heart magnetized by Ganesha’s grace, where every darshan renews the covenant that wishes made in faith are carried to fruition by the Lord of Beginnings.
