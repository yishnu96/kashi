## The Sacred Story

_‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana_

In the Kashi Khanda, Bhagavan Skanda narrates how Mahaganapati assigns fifty-six Vinayaka forms across the Kashi Mandala to guard every pilgrim‚Äôs step, sanctify every direction, and dissolve every obstacle before Sri Vishveshvara‚Äôs city, establishing a complete circle of protection and grace around the Avimukta Kshetra. Among these luminous guardians stands Moda Vinayak, the embodiment of divine delight, stationed in the inner city at the Kashi Karvat precinct so that the journey through Kashi‚Äôs dense lanes becomes inwardly joyful and outwardly unhindered.

As the Mandala is revealed, each Vinayak receives a distinct *sankalpa* and sphere, creating layers of auspicious circles in which the pilgrim‚Äôs consciousness ascends toward Shiva‚Äôs supreme abode; Moda‚Äôs *sankalpa* is to transmute strain into joy and fear into courage, so the devotee‚Äôs *vrata* does not falter amidst the demanding alleys and bustling *chowks*. Moda Vinayak, by *naam* and nature, confers ‚Äú*moda*‚Äù‚Äîa serene, *sattvic* happiness‚Äîso that the sacred itinerary of the Chappan Vinayak Yatra is completed with a heart made light, mind made clear, and steps made steady towards Vishwanath‚Äôs darshan.

The placement within Kashi Karvat is purposeful: Karvat‚Äôs tight passages and concentrated spiritual charge act as a crucible where obstacles, impatience, and distraction may arise, and here Moda stands as remover and sweetener of experience, transforming the necessary *tapas* of the path into relishable devotion. Thus, when the pilgrim moves from Chowk into Naipali/Nepali Khapra and enters the Karvat precinct, the first whisper of relief and clarity in the mind is the *prasada* of Moda Vinayak.

Kashi Khanda‚Äôs theology of circles ensures that no journey segment is bereft of Vinayak‚Äôs guardianship; in the seventh circle, listings preserve Moda as a fixed point of grace, so the devotee‚Äôs inner *vrata* remains intact across days and distances. The very name Moda becomes a mantra of intent: each *pranama* before the shrine is a surrender of heaviness and a reception of the Lord‚Äôs *ananda* that pervades Kashi like the unstruck sound.

Across the ages, local custodians have kept the shrine approachable and simple, aligning with Vinayaka‚Äôs immediate help to the pilgrim, without layers of formalities that might delay the swift removal of *vighnas* in the *mandala‚Äôs* heartbeat lanes. The self-pooja character lets every traveler become a participant in Kashi Khanda‚Äôs living circuit, linking the act of lighting a lamp or offering a flower directly to the puranic map that still breathes in the city‚Äôs sacred geography.

For the seeker traversing Kashi‚Äôs heritage streets, the darshan of Moda Vinayak functions like an inner sunrise; the city‚Äôs density turns into devotion‚Äôs intimacy, and the path ahead opens towards the next Vinayaka and, finally, to Vishveshvara‚Äôs *jyotir-linga* grace. In this manner, the Sthala Purana of Moda Vinayak merges seamlessly with the larger Chappan Vinayak tapestry, securing delight as the natural mood of the *yatra* and ensuring that every obstacle becomes an instrument of awakening under Ganapati‚Äôs compassionate gaze.
