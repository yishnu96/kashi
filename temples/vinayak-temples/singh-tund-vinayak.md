## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

In Kashi Khanda, during the Padma Kalpa, the earth suffered a devastating drought that disturbed the order of life and *dharma* across Bharata, compelling Lord Brahma to seek a sovereign who could restore balance through righteous rule and disciplined governance over the whole earth.

Lord Brahma anointed King Ripunjaya as Divodasa, entrusting him with dominion and the vow to maintain human *dharma*, with the divine hosts temporarily withdrawing from Kashi to ensure the king‚Äôs unimpeded establishment of just rule and civic perfection in the sacred city.

As time passed, Divodasa built an exemplary order where drought ceased, prosperity surged, and public life attained refinement, yet the austerity of the pact prevented Mahadev from entering Kashi until a suitable pathway for His return was revealed within the very fabric of *dharma* itself.

The divine strategy unfolded through emissaries who would examine the kingdom‚Äôs hidden lapses and awaken a need for the Lord‚Äôs presence, culminating in the mission of Sri Ganesh to enter Kashi, discern the subtle flaws, and open the city once more to Mahadev‚Äôs eternal sovereignty over the Avimukta Kshetra.

Sri Ganesh assumed fifty-six distinct forms and established these Vinayaks throughout Kashi, ordering them in seven concentric folds so that each fold would guard, purify, and empower the city and its pilgrims in the eight directions and inner sanctified circuits of life and *sadhana*.

As the Vinayaks took their seats, the people of Kashi found relief from hindrances, clarity of mind, and the rekindling of devotion that naturally arose when the city‚Äôs divine geometry, anchored by Ganeshic *shakti*, reconnected every *gully*, ghat, and *mandir* to Mahadev‚Äôs living presence.

Within this sacred design, Singh Tund Vinayak stands in the fourth fold, a layer of guardians who actively destroy the troubles and obstacles of worshippers, ensuring the pathway to Shiva and Shakti remains free of karmic entanglements for those who complete darshan with devotion.

The fourth fold, named in Kashi Khanda, includes Abhayaprada, Singh Tund, Kuditaksha, Kshipraprasadana, Chintamani, Danthasta, Pichandila, and Udandamukha Vinayaks, together forging a powerful circuit for pacifying adversity and securing swift divine grace in the seeker‚Äôs life.

Singh Tund Vinayak near Dashashwamedh Ghat is venerated as the remover of sins, bringing purification when sincere prayers and *stotra* recitation are offered, aligning the devotee‚Äôs inner resolve with the protective intent of Ganesh over Kashi‚Äôs spiritual avenues.

Pilgrims weave through Khalispura‚Äôs lanes to reach this seat, offering *pranams* to the Lord whose presence affirms that Kashi‚Äôs guardianship is not abstract but embodied in approachable deities whose darshan concretely dissolves the burdens that inhibit progress on the path.

The Chhappan Vinayak Yatra, completed in seven segments, mirrors the original establishment of these forms, allowing devotees to retrace Sri Ganesh‚Äôs sanctification of the city while receiving wisdom, success, and fearlessness as enumerated in the Kashi Khanda‚Äôs teaching and praise.

Kashi Khanda states that those who worship these 56 Vinayaks gain divine knowledge, success at every step, and freedom from sins, which is why Singh Tund Vinayak darshan is pursued earnestly by pilgrims who seek both inner transformation and the protection of Kashi‚Äôs *dharmic* order.

In this unfolding, the return of Mahadev to Kashi becomes not a single moment but a complete restoration enacted through Ganesh‚Äôs fifty-six forms, each a doorway‚ÄîSingh Tund among them‚Äîthrough which obstacles are removed, merits are strengthened, and the city reawakens to Shiva‚Äôs uninterrupted grace.

Thus, the pilgrim who bows before Singh Tund Vinayak participates directly in the divine arrangement that sustains Kashi, receiving the boon of sin-removal and the courage to continue the sevenfold pilgrimage that harmonizes personal life with the eternal Avimukta field.
