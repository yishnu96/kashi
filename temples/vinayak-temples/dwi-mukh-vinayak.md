## History of the Mandir

  * **Scripturally anchored in Kashi Khanda** as a key Vinayak granting *sarvato-mukhi shri*, placed near Suraj Kund to harmonise Surya‚Äôs *tejas* with Ganesh‚Äôs grace.
  * **Seated inside/adjacent to the Samba Aditya temple**, reflecting the puranic lineage of Surya worship associated with Samba, son of Shri Krishna.
  * **Preserves Kashi‚Äôs wayside-sanctum style**: compact *garbhagriha*, continuous self-puja, and community-led upkeep rather than royal-endowment liturgy.
  * **As Nai Sarak evolved** into Kashi‚Äôs book and study belt, the shrine grew popular among students, teachers, publishers, and traders seeking holistic progress.
  * **Present worship remains simple and personal**, centered on *sankalpa*, modest offerings, and thanksgiving visits after fulfillment.

## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

When Shri Vishwanath re-established his eternal seat in Avimukta Kashi, Shri Ganesh appeared across the city as distinct Vinayaks to guide every path of human effort. At Suraj Kund, where Surya‚Äôs radiance gathers and steadies life, he chose the presence of Dwi Mukh Vinayak‚Äîthe two-faced Lord‚Äîso prosperity would arise in all directions and decisions would be guided by clarity rather than haste. The two faces are a living teaching: one attends to the outer world of action and trade; the other watches the inner world of intent and *dharma*. When both are aligned, prosperity endures.

In the puranic current that runs through this precinct, Samba Aditya shines as Surya‚Äôs grace to Samba, son of Shri Krishna, whose healing established a line of worship that joins vitality with discipline. Dwi Mukh Vinayak completes that rhythm. Surya bestows *tejas*‚Äîenergy and brilliance; Ganesh shapes that energy into obstacles removed, work begun rightly, and effort that yields steady fruit. Thus, Sunday sunrise at Suraj Kund followed by darshan of Dwi Mukh Vinayak has long been a beloved sequence of Kashi‚Äôs residents.

A weaver from Nai Sarak once stood here at dawn with a modest vow‚Äîfair weights, gentle speech in the rush of orders, and a promise to teach one apprentice each season at no fee. The shrine answered not with sudden riches, but with a dependable tide: raw material arrived on time, buyers paid within reason, and quarrels that used to bloom among workers found no soil. He later said that Dwi Mukh Vinayak had taught him to keep both faces‚Äîbusiness and conscience‚Äîlooking in the same direction.

A young scholar approached next, burdened by a mind that wandered and a timetable that slipped. Her *sankalpa* was simple: one honest hour before the market wakes, one hour given to teach a younger cousin in the evening, and one day a week without complaint. She placed a flower and a small *modak*, repeated the mantra softly, and began with Suraj Kund‚Äôs quiet light on her face. Weeks later, the same chapter that had felt like a hill had become familiar ground. She returned to say that prosperity had arrived not only as marks, but as a steadier breath.

Traders in the lane learned a gentle covenant with the shrine. They would keep their goods an arm‚Äôs length inside to spare the walkway, set a brass pot of water for passersby in the heat, and refuse to pass rumours even when business was slow. In return, Dwi Mukh Vinayak made delays short-lived, sent the right helpers at the right time, and softened the edges of tense mornings. The shrine‚Äôs boon is not loud; it is precise timekeeping, clear minds, and neighbours who become solutions instead of obstacles.

Elders say the ‚Äútwo faces‚Äù are also two moments‚Äîbefore and after. Before a task: purify intention, ask for obstacle-removal, and begin without noise. After a task: return in thanksgiving regardless of scale and ask that success build character. The shrine loves such discipline. Families who keep it report that luck becomes less moody; it behaves like a friend who arrives when called. Students discover that memory responds to kindness given as tuition to another. Shopkeepers find that steady courtesy is better insurance than any contract.
