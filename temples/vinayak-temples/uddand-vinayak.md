## The Sacred Story

_‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana_

In the Padma Kalpa, when the earth suffered a devastating drought, Brahma entrusted King Ripunjay‚Äînow enthroned as King Divodasa‚Äîwith the charge to rule faultlessly, under a covenant that kept the devas outside Kashi so human righteousness could flourish without celestial interference, establishing a divine test that shaped the destiny of the Avimukta Kshetra.

As Divodasa‚Äôs rule perfected *dharma*, Mahadev resolved to return to Kashi, yet the king‚Äôs covenant prevented direct entry, leading to a sacred sequence where emissaries sought a path to restore Shiva‚Äôs presence without breaking the vow that safeguarded the city‚Äôs moral order.

In this mission, Ganapati entered Kashi to discern the subtle flaws in human order that could open a rightful way for Shiva‚Äôs return, acting with unmatched wisdom to balance the covenant with the eternal right of Mahadev to reside at the cosmic seat of liberation, Avimukta.

Upon the successful restoration of Shiva‚Äôs presence, Ganapati consecrated himself across Kashi in fifty‚Äësix forms, arranging a protective *mandala* in seven concentric folds, so that each fold‚Äôs eight Vinayaks would guard the sacred geography and remove the obstacles of those who dwell in and pilgrimage to the holy city.

The outermost fold established eight Vinayaks‚ÄîArk, Durg, Bheemchandi, Dehli, Uddand, Pashpani, Kharv, and Siddhi‚Äîto watch the thresholds of Kashi, granting *siddhis* to devotees and dealing sternly with neglect of righteous worship in a city whose very breath is mantra and whose streets are *tirthas*.

On the Bhimchandi‚ÄìRameshwar leg of the Panchkroshi *Parikrama*, Ganapati placed Uddand Vinayak at Bhuili, just before the Rameshwar halt, so pilgrims would first bow to this powerful remover of entrenched impediments and then continue to Rameshwar in a flow synchronized with the route‚Äôs ancient rhythm.

Uddand‚Äîunyielding to *adharma* and relentless against obstacles‚Äîbecame the vow-bound guardian for travelers on this segment, clearing weighty blocks that resist ordinary effort and aligning the devotee‚Äôs journey with the auspicious current that leads to Rameshwar‚Äôs grace and onward stations of the *parikrama*.

Because this deity stands in the outermost protective ring, darshan here is treated as a gateway act: a setting‚Äëright of the path before stepping to the next *kshetra*, the very design of the Ashta Vinayak first fold ensuring a pilgrim crosses the threshold into deeper sanctity, obstacle‚Äëfree.

In keeping with the Ashta Vinayak Yatra‚Äôs promise, those who include Uddand Vinayak in their circuit receive not just the removal of hindrances but also the rise of knowledge and prosperity that accompany unobstructed movement through Kashi‚Äôs sanctified routes and vows, completing the circle Mahadev desired for his beloved city.

Thus, Uddand Vinayak‚Äôs *sthala* stands as resolve incarnate in the northwest of Kashi, tying the pilgrim‚Äôs determination to the deity‚Äôs force, so the remaining Panchkroshi milestones unfold smoothly and the inner journey reflects the outer path‚Äôs clarity and order.
