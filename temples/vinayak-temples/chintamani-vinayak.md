## History of the Mandir

  * **Counted among Kashi‚Äôs Chappan Vinayak** network, which maps Ganesh‚Äôs compassionate forms across the sacred city‚Äôs lanes and *tirthas*.
  * **Established near Ishwar Gangi Talab**, a known local landmark, reflecting Kashi‚Äôs pattern of placing Vinayaka shrines by waterbodies and study‚Äìmarket belts.
  * **A compact sanctum** that preserves Kashi‚Äôs wayside puja tradition‚Äîcontinuous self-puja by residents, students, and traders.
  * **Periodic local refurbishments** have kept the shrine accessible as lane systems evolved around Babu Bazar and Laburabir.
  * **Present worship emphasises *sankalpa*** for worry-free action, examinations, household peace, and honest livelihood.

## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

When Shri Vishwanath affirmed Kashi as Avimukta‚Äîthe city never forsaken‚ÄîShri Ganesh took many forms across its living map so that every traveller, householder, student, and trader could begin rightly and proceed without inner storms. At the calm edge of Ishwar Gangi Talab, he abides as Chintamani Vinayak, the gentle granter who dissolves worry and replaces it with lucid resolve. In the sacred arrangement of the city, waterbodies collect the mind‚Äôs heat; here, *chinta* is cooled into clarity, and the day‚Äôs duties move forward in a steady rhythm.

In the lanes around the Talab, life has always mixed learning with livelihood. The early morning calls of vendors meet the soft recitations from homes where children revise lessons before the market wakes. Chintamani Vinayak watches over this ordinary sanctity, taking the pulse of a city that works and prays in the same breath. Devotees arrive with small offerings: a few blades of *durva*, a marigold, a *laddu* whose sweetness matches the simplicity of their requests. They do not ask for grand spectacle. They ask for a quiet mind that can keep its promises.

An old telling speaks of a schoolgirl who would master her chapters by dusk yet lose her confidence by dawn. Her mother brought her to Chintamani Vinayak on a Wednesday, asked for nothing extravagant, and vowed an hour of study service for a younger child every evening. The shrine gave the girl a different victory: not just answers on exam day, but the ability to breathe when the bell rang and the question paper settled on the desk. The result was good; the greater gift was a mind that had learned to stay.

A trader from Babu Bazar came during a season of price swings and frayed tempers. He placed a small *modak* and promised fair weights, honest speech, and a monthly donation of notebooks to a nearby school. His ledger did not turn into a miracle overnight, but disputes softened, suppliers kept time, and customers began to greet with respect instead of suspicion. When asked later, he said the Lord had changed one habit first‚Äîhe now paused before speaking when anger rose, and this single pause saved many days.

There is a householder‚Äôs story that returns to the shrine every few years. A family facing anxiety about an ailing parent began a forty-day *vrata*, offering *durva* and simple sweets each morning and sharing a portion with neighbours. Their prayer was not to command destiny, but to steady everyone in the home and to invite the right doctors, the right medicines, and the right patience. The recovery took time; the worry lost its claws quickly. The family often says that the home‚Äôs atmosphere changed first‚Äîthe Lord gave them one mind, and the rest followed.

The teachers of Kashi say that worry is not always an enemy; it is a messenger that the mind has forgotten its seat. Chintamani Vinayak reinstates that seat. At this shrine, devotees learn a gentle technique: speak the *sankalpa* clearly, keep it truthful, tie it to service, and let the mantra anchor the hour that follows. In this way, hope matures into action. The shrine does not reward haste; it blesses steadiness. Those who seek quick fixes are taught to breathe; those who have given up are taught to try again, but with a calmer hand.
