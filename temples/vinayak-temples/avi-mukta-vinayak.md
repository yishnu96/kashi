## The Sacred Story

*‚îÄ‚îÄ From Sthala Purana*

Avimukta Kshetra is the everlasting seat where Shiva never forsakes his devotee, and within this unbroken field of grace, Avi Mukta Vinayak stands at the threshold to remove the distress that clouds resolve and to keep the seeker steady under Vishwanath‚Äôs compassionate gaze. In Kashi‚Äôs sacred arrangement, darshan of Avimukteshwar and Avi Mukta Vinayak becomes a single current‚ÄîShiva‚Äôs eternal presence and Ganesh‚Äôs immediate assistance working together to purify, protect, and guide. The devotee who steps into the precincts finds two openings for Ganesh‚Äôs blessing, one quiet on the Gyanvapi wall and one within the Vishwanath premises, together preserving the continuity of worship through centuries of change.

When the Avimukta field was declared by Shiva as the city never abandoned, he placed guardians at every passage where intention must turn into action, and Avi Mukta Vinayak was established so that no distress would hold back a rightful vow. The pilgrim who comes with burdens‚Äîdebts of heart, tangles of duty, fear of time‚Äôs uncertainties‚Äîplaces a simple offering and a mantra before Ganesh and finds the pressure begin to ease, not by escape, but by clarity and strength. The Kashi Khanda tradition praises this darshan as a purifier of obstacles specifically for those who dwell in or undertake *sadhana* within Avimukta Kshetra, ensuring that the city‚Äôs promise‚Äîof protection and ultimate release‚Äîremains accessible every day.

An old tale from the lanes speaks of a householder who lost direction after a season of hardship and stood between the two darshan points, uncertain where to start, until a *sevak* gently guided him to bow first at the wall shrine and then within the premises, sewing together memory and resolve. The act was small, but in Avimukta such gestures are acts of alignment‚Äîchoosing to be seen by the Lord who never leaves and by the remover of hindrances who stands at the door. The man‚Äôs days did not turn into ease overnight, but he began to meet his obligations without the panic that had been his secret jail, and his family later said that the darshan had made him steady again.

Sages explain that Avimukteshwar‚Äôs boon is vast merit and freedom from rebirth, while Avi Mukta Vinayak‚Äôs boon is immediate clearing of distress that blocks meritorious living, so that the devotee can walk toward that greater freedom with clean steps. Therefore, those who come for Vishwanath often include both darshans in one breath‚ÄîAvimukteshwar for the deep horizon, Avi Mukta Vinayak for the near path, and Vishwanath for the embrace that holds them both. The city itself becomes a liturgy: entry through protected thresholds, purification of fear, and confirmation in Shiva‚Äôs court.

In living practice, families arrive from across the lanes and distant towns during Vinayaka Chaturthi and Sankashti days, joining the Ashta Pradhan Vinayak Yatra that threads Ganesh shrines as a garland of readiness around Kashi. Avi Mukta Vinayak is a pivotal bead in that garland; its twofold presence ensures that even when an old icon is lost to history, the blessing is not lost, because Avimukta keeps the vow of unbroken protection. The darshan teaches that help is near at hand for those who stand and ask with sincerity, and that Kashi‚Äôs grace is not an abstract idea but a daily discipline of small offerings, clear speech, and steadfast work.
