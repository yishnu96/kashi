## Scriptural Quote (Shloka)

:::shloka[Rigveda, Mandala 2, Sukta 23, Mantra 1]

“गणानां त्वा गणपतिं हवामहे कविं कवीनामुपमश्रवस्तमम्। <br/>
ज्येष्ठराजं ब्रह्मणां ब्रह्मणस्पत आ नः शृण्वन्नूतिभिः सीद सादनम्॥”

“We invoke you, O Ganapati, lord of the groups, the sage among sages, best of the wise; the foremost king of Brahmanas, O Brahmanaspati, hear us and come with your support to sit in this seat”.

## History of the Mandir

  * **1690 CE**: Shri Dhondu Paudkar discovered the *swayambhu* Ganesha idol in a nearby lake at Mahad and the deity was briefly kept in a local goddess shrine.
  * **1725 CE**: Peshwa general Ramji Mahadev Biwalkar constructed the present temple and developed the village, placing the self-manifested Varad Vinayak for formal worship.
  * **Late 19th century**: A Nandadeep was kindled and has remained lit continuously since 1892, reflecting uninterrupted *seva* at Mahad.
  * **20th century**: Due to weathering of the original idol, a new idol was consecrated in the sanctum while the original remains displayed outside; a legal matter regarding this change has been noted locally.
  * **Architecture and layout**: Stone sanctum with four elephant carvings, an 8×8-foot *garbhagriha*, a 25-foot dome with a golden *kalash* bearing cobra carvings, gomukh on the north, and a sacred pond to the west.

## The Sacred Story

*── From Sthala Purana*

King Rukmaganda, famed for *dharma*, once entered the hermitage of Rishi Vachaknavi, where the rishi’s wife Mukunda beheld the prince’s noble form and sought union with him. Rukmaganda refused, honoring the sanctity of the ashram, and departed, leaving Mukunda oppressed by desire. Indra, lord of the devas, assumed the form of Rukmaganda, united with Mukunda, and in time she bore a son, Gritsamada. When Gritsamada learned the truth of his divine paternity, he cursed Mukunda, and she cursed him in return to father a mighty *asura*. Seeking release, Gritsamada turned to *tapas* in the Pushpak forest, invoking Ganapati.

Pleased, Shri Ganesha appeared as Varada—the bestower—granting blessings that would reshape the family’s fate. Ganesha promised that the son born to Gritsamada, foreordained as Tripurasura, would be conquerable only by Lord Shiva, preserving cosmic balance. Gritsamada then requested the permanent presence of Ganapati in that forest and established a temple there.

From that sanctified presence arose the name Varad Vinayak—Ganapati who confers *varas* (boons) freely to those who bow with sincerity—enshrining the *kshetra* as a *tirtha* for wish-fulfillment. In time, the *swayambhu* *murti* of Varad Vinayak emerged at Mahad and came under formal worship, its form embodying the same boon-bestowing grace revealed to Gritsamada.

The temple’s features mirror the story’s sanctity: the gomukh offers *tirtha*, the western pond holds the memory of the idol’s discovery, and the Nandadeep burns unceasingly as a symbol of uninterrupted *tapas* and *bhakti*. Close darshan within the sanctum is a living sign of Varada’s compassion, inviting pilgrims to come near, whisper prayers, and carry away the blessing of accomplishment.
