# Adi Keshav

A small Paragraph eg: Adi Keshav stands at the sacred confluence of the Ganga and Varuna, where Lord Vishnu first set foot in Kashi, making it the first and foremost Vishnutirtha of the city as described in Kashi Khanda and noted in the Matsya Purana tradition for this ghat‚Äôs sanctity. The temple houses Adi Keshav alongside Sangameshwar, a four-faced linga installed by Adi Keshav, and grants moksha, happiness, and relief from sorrow through darshan and worship here.
